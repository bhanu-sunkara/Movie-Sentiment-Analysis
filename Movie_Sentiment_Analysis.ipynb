      "The expand match is <function expand_contractions.<locals>.expand_match at 0x0000015CE58F1510> and text is the main issue with this movie is that it cannot decide whether it's a frame by frame remake, or a serious toned adaptation. it's both when it shouldn't be. favreau absolutely nailed the dichotomy of the two styles in jungle book and simply failed in lion king. the jungle book has believability when baloo sings to himself/mogli while floating the river. king louis doesn't sing when he's confronting mogli and the scene is immensely more terrifying and believable. i wasn't scared of scar when he “sang” be prepared. i didn't feel whimsical at can't wait to be king. honestly the best musical segment was lion sleeps tonight because it provided some comical relief and built itself naturally. speaking of poor music choices, lion king 2019 had the opportunity to truly marry the beloved animated film with the beloved broadway musical and just...didn't. the available soundtrack even has several songs from the broadway show, yet the film does not use them. instead of “he lives in you” we have beyoncé singing “spirit” over and over. rather than “shadowlands”, we have...”be our guest?” the beauty and the beast reference was completely out of place and really took away from the scene. lastly, although the animation is beautifully done, favreau dug his heels in on the realism. the magnificent color pallet and character design/humanism in the original animated film is replaced with emotionless hyper-realistic animals and sets. no longer the rich and dramatically colorful landscapes and emotive characters, but more of the dry earth tones and expressionless animals. any wildlife documentary does a better job of highlighting africa's immense beauty and diversity. i can understand favreau's desire to cater to the nostalgic audience, but it feels, again, like he couldn't decide what movie he wanted to make. was it a frame by frame remake or was is a serious toned adaptation with small tributes to the source material? yes.\n",

      "\n",
      "(1). the cinematography. what i'm about to say may not make sense at first, but bear with me. i truly believe that some absolutely amazing work was done in terms of the visual effects for this film. so much time and effort was put in from this department and it shows in its realism (even if it does cross into the uncanny valley occasionally). however, despite this fact, the movie is so visually boring. sure, the visual effects of the film may look realistic, but that doesn't mean they look good from an artistic perspective. everything is just so dull looking and anticolorful. sure it looks like i'm watching a documentary, but it's a documentary that contains flat, boring shots that do nothing to show off the beauty of africa. if you want visuals like that, go watch planet earth. that movie is stunning! compare the visuals of the remake to that of the animated original. because the original isn't hindered by its ideology that it has to look as realistic as possible, it has the creative freedom to exaggerate. to do things that you just couldn't without it being animated. one scene, in particular, was that of \"i just can't wait to be king\". in the original, as soon as the music hits, the animation changes and the world becomes gorgeously colorful. the whole scene is simba and nala interacting with all the animals in fun and creative ways that make for a joyous time. contrast to the original and its both of them running around the watering hole trying to hide from zazu. nothing special. the problem with the choice of making it look like a documentary is that it adds restrictions to the film that the original could ignore and run wild with! the visual style may look realistic for the most part, but that doesn't mean it looks good.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2).the performances. i have to first off preface this by stating that i in no way believe that any the actors in this film are bad actors. on the contrary, there is a whole lot of voice-talent in this film! however, what we hear is only half of what we get when it comes to performances in a film like this. that other half of the performances was that of the facial expressions. especially the ones pertaining to any of the lion characters. i know this goes back a little to the previous point i made, but the idea of making this film look hyperrealistic hurt this film in so many ways! because they decided that these lions need to look and act as realistic as possible, they dumbed down their facial expressions to the point that you can barely tell what any of them are thinking. it merely looked like voices dubbed poorly over nature documentary footage. imagine seeing an actor sound like they are truly crying and balling as they stare at the lifeless body of their father with eyes that only seem mildly upset. that is what watching this film was like. i could never take any of these performances seriously despite the talent behind these voices. even james earl jones sounded bored in this movie!! the only real exceptions to this in the film were from timon and pumba. they were hilarious! they were allowed to be different and the animation used for them allowed the expressiveness in their voice to actually come out and shine. \n",
      "\n",
      "there were many other problems i had with the film (i.e. theme removal, incredibly rushed scene pacing, \"be prepared\" is shortened to a sloppy mess, and way too many riffs from beyonce and donald glover), but these two points were the main ones that stuck out to me.\n",
      "The expand match is <function expand_contractions.<locals>.expand_match at 0x0000015CE58F1510> and text is the cgi was great, but that destroyed a lot of the emotion the cast was trying to show the audience. there is no point in watching this movie if you have access to the original 1994 lion king.\n",

      "however, as a movie, i was quite disappointed and even... bored. and i love the lion king and the story line. some of the voice actors seemed apathetic reading the lines, even james earl jones. i realize it can't be easy to redo lines, but he sounded like he had gotten stopped at a con and asked to say the lines for the 20th time that day. the kid actors' lines were cringy, and timon and pumba sounded like they were trying to rile up an unresponsive crowd. the animators made pretty much no effort to show emotion on the animal's faces. simba looked the same when his dad died as when he was singing i just can't wait to be king. i understand they were going for realistic and not cartoony, but my dog shows more emotion on a daily basis with ears and eyebrows and body language. it doesn't have to be human-ized to be emotional. the songs that we grew to love were shortened or talked through instead of sung. be prepared was the worst example of this. also, with the award-winning broadway show music right there why invent a new song for simba to cross the desert to?\n",

'be prepared' one of our favorite disney villain songs is replaced by something of a strange spoken word yet syncopated soliloquy. my wife also noticed two percieved \"woke\" moments that i was oblivious to. if you can explain that violence against bullies is wrong, and that a male lion could handle a clan of hyenas on his own your kids should be fine. altogether, as with all the recent disney remakes, it's okay, but nowhere near as magical as the original.\n",

      "The expand match is <function expand_contractions.<locals>.expand_match at 0x0000015CE59471E0> and text is first of all, the special effects in this film are outstanding and you can see all of the effort that went into it. all of the animal's act like their actual animal counterparts if you saw them in the wild. timon, voiced by billy eichner, and pumbaa, voiced by seth rogen, stole the show in their scenes. they both were perfectly casted and brought some of the humour in this film. for the rest of the cast, i can't really say the same thing. don't get me wrong donald glover/childish gambino, who voices adult simba, and beyoncé, who voices nala, did decent enough jobs with their parts and i could easily hear them with their parts but others just needed a change in casting. my main problem with the casting was with chiwetel ejiofor as scar i just couldn't hear him as the villain. trust me i tried to forget about jeremy irons but i just couldn't. jeremy irons made this character iconic for a reason and i feel like if they got somebody else it would have been a bit better. this film added forty extra minutes on to the run time, probably to show off the effects, but you can feel it especially when they change something or add something in. for me, this happened at the ending where they changed not just one of the funniest scenes but also made a scene longer than it should have been. the songs in this version just didn't give off the same spectacle as in the original version. the original used the sets and lighting to help bring you into the numbers this one has nothing to make you interested in them. at certain points, the lighting would change for no reason. what i mean is that it would be day time and then just a couple of seconds later it would be dark. but hey, at least we have another great score by hans zimmer. in the end, the lion king (2019) just doesn't live up to the original. if nothing else is showing and you need to beat the heat this summer than go ahead and check it out but if not just stay home and watch the 1994 one. i give the lion king (2019) a 5.5/10.\n",
