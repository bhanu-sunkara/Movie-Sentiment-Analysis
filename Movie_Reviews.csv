This version seems to have cut out a lot of dialogue in favor of more exposition so that the plot and character motives become much more obvious.The only time where I felt like this was an improvement was the first scenes showing the changes to the pride lands. Most of the musical scores were true to the original, but they ruined ""Be Prepared"".

61,966701625,Hope L,"I don't think the fact that it's almost exactly like the original is an issue. That's what should be expected. The problem is that they *didn't* recreate the original scenes to properly represent the original. I feel like they could have easily included more emotion and time for important scenes (which is what the audience is specifically interested in for nostalgia). The movie simply feels rushed. It seems like, because the main focus of this film was for the CGI to be breathtaking, that there wasn't enough attention to other important factors when it comes to creating movies. Timing, improvisation, and being more careful with details doesn't seem to have been on their minds. l did enjoy this movie, but when it's clear that so much could have easily been corrected to make the film better, it's disappointing.

Almost as if all voices, songs, and acting were done from in separate studios and mashed together. I was entertained, however not worth seeing in theaters.

Now if you're 3 years old, you don't notice things like this, but the Industry has to get a clue that when you remake a CLASSIC, you at least have to make it as good or better....they left out funny scenes and changed the dialogue which didn't enhance the scenes. Also, the theater sound was horrible, the voices were to the left, the music to the right, the WHOLE experience was just totally disappointing. Disney is not doing very good quality control and it shows. The CGI was amazing, but you didn't have the right voices for the characters, especially SCAR, it was just terrible.

But there were obvious places where the CGI didn't align with the movements physics-wise (mostly gravity issues), and sound-wise when it came to the mouth movements. I know for a fact that they aren't aren't using their full capabilities yet, especially with AI technology at their disposal, and I bet this was a gold mine at the box office. The only reason I brought this up is because - how in the world are you going to make a live-action film that's most obviously not live-action? Stop grabbing people's money with cheap tricks. Get CGI to where I can't tell a difference at all before you start calling CGI films, live-action films. Duh. 

Everything else was pretty much regular Lion King, although I really did enjoy some of the human-like expressive behavior coming from mostly Zazu. The bird's natural fast-twitch muscle behavior along with the expressive voice and synced-up beak, really did sort of make me think there was some sort of talking bird in the midst of us.",2019-08-22T13:24:19.222Z,1.0

And then we had it on DVD and watched it a million more times. We know every word. The original was one of the best Disney movies ever, in my opinion. So, when we heard about the remake 25 years later we were excited and went to see it together again. The effects are nice, but they're not, because the characters lacked the heart and emotion and humor of the first film. It just wasn't the same at all. And Scar's character was completely different.

The original movie was a product of wonderful and captivating storytelling, but the remake tosses all of this aside by creating realistic-looking animals and scenery. The beauty of the original movie was beheld on the imagination and beauty of visuals, and while this film arguably does the same, it does so in a way that does not foster creativity or atmospheric wonder.",2019-08-21T20:17:23.239Z,0.0

178,978198611,Bassil O,"This movie is good but not amazing because it is a shot for shot remake of the 1994 one but somehow did better than the original  and is at the time of the review the 9th highest grossing movie of cinema history although not deserving it the. The scenes that the movie does change are weird and makes me question why like instead of Simba accidentally  sending some dust to Rafiki through wind. NOW Simbas hair lands on a leaf  and is eaten by a Giraffe and then it poops it out and a dung beetle rolls it to Rafiki and it breaks , but why was Rafiki looking at poop . Do you remember that scene where Rafiki  hits Simba on his heas and says that it doesnt matter because it is in the past that is GONE all GONE , but why it was the a moral of the story . Jon favreau   has made alot better the jungle book ( 2016 ) Iron Man and more this is easily the worst movie from him yet this guy helped make ENDGAME ...  ENDGAME  the actors who I will address are Beyonce and Seth Rogen . It felt like beyonce did not try at all but thrived in the scenes where she sang but it is the opposite for Seth Rogen he was an amazing actor but not a good singer . the last thing I will say is the jokes were funny especially the thats local were is it from right there joke .It was flawed but undeserving of the criticisms it is getting I would recommend  it best to watch with family .

This was my favorite animated film in the 90s and I watched it almost every single day of my childhood, so watching it come to life was simply magical. I guess some people were not pleased that it is almost exactly like the original, but that's what I loved about it. It made me nostalgic and so, so happy. The imagery throughout was so beautiful as well. My only real critique is that I thought a few of the voices didn't seem like the right fit, like Nala's, which didn't sound at all like the soft, sweet original voice, for example, and a couple of others. I also felt like some scenes were rushed or over too fast, but overall, this movie is a win for me. Love this movie now and forever.",2019-08-20T23:51:22.290Z,1.0

The cinematics was the ONLY positive thing about this movie. The mouth movements of the animals were nowhere near matching what they were saying, which is a major key in my opinion, that counted for about 80% of what made the movie bad to me. The second reason I hated it was because it was too National Geographic looking. It was like watching an entire discovery channel movie in the theater, and that wasn‚Äôt a good thing for me because I HATE the discovery channel! They should have left this one alone. I didn‚Äôt really like the Alladin movie that much but it was definitely way better than this crap.

The voice actor for Timon (Billy Eichner) was apparently required to have the most over the top gay affectation possible (although one of the best singers).

376,971578654,critical m,"Overall and OK film. Technically well-executed, but creatively uninspired. Pretty much a scene-by-scene replica of the original, which makes it palatable for all ages because the original was good, but also feels uninspired and ""cheap."" The best I can describe it is like watching a production of a Shakespeare play that you've read/seen so many times, but this time with different actors, costumes and sets pieces. It's fun to watch just for the nostalgia appeal. The voice acting was well-done all around except for Beyonce who sounded like...well Beyonce reading a script. Parts of the script felt out-dated, out of touch or cheesy, for instance, there was a lot of cringey, campy ""Come-ons!"" and ""Let's do this!"" lines from the child actors. In one scene Beyonce's character literally yells ""Lions, Attack!""  Meanwhile, they threw in a few twists on certain scenes and transitions but they are so small you might not notice. The most annoying part of the movie was one of these scenes in which they replace the original score with the most random Beyonce song, who was singing as Beyonce and not as her character Nala. It felt so wrong, out of place and obnoxious. All in all worth an end of summer family trip to the movie, but otherwise, you won't miss much by waiting for the DVD/BluRay.",2019-08-18T20:19:47.794Z,1.0

I think Jon Favreau is a creative genius in his visionary take on projects. Unfortunately Disney got the Lion King right the first time, which didn‚Äôt necessitate a remake. Which is why 90% of the original had been untouched for the 2019 version. HOWEVER... I think Favreau‚Äôs brilliance will really come through if they get him to make a Lion King 2. The original is impossible to beat. But the sequels and spinoffs are much less memorable for MOST fans, yet still provide an excellent foundation for someone like Favreau to take it and really make it something special. Just like he did with Jungle Book. Jungle Book had plenty of room for creative reimagining because it‚Äôs not as widely memorable, which is where he could take liberties that he simply didn‚Äôt have with Lion King. I honestly think that the remake we got is by far the best possible job any director could‚Äôve done with the scope of the task at hand.

From minute one, Lion King demonstrated the awesome master combination of Disney filmmaking technics far beyond Walt Disney graphics beginnings.

A scene or two later into the story, a mean aggressive hyena suddenly pops up from the shadows threatening our innocent heroes in the story. 
Unfortunately, the scene was shockingly racial. 
The audiovisual was too overt to escape my sensibilities. 
The hyena was black. Hyenas are generally tan or grey. Not black. You could blame it on the lighting but the hyena was black.

In fact, it appears that the mean hyena was crafted to emulate a black person. Furthermore, its voice over sounded like a black man. 

Of course the little children in the audience had no clue they were being brainwashed.

Lion King storyline attempted the proverbial Joseph Campbell mono-myth dramatic curve.  They even had the cleansing rain at the end but it was no help to improve the  distasteful bathroom humor.
Lion King failed to sustain the tit-for-tat excitement of Disney yesteryears movies.

484,977719088,Mani P,"The Lion King is a 2019 remake of the 1994 Disney classic The Lion King. The film was directed by Jon Favreau, and stars Donald Glover as Simba and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar.

The film in my opinion is a disgrace to the original film, from the emotionless character expressions to the dreadful and unfitting voice acting.

The story was basically the same as the original (nearly down to the beat), but for some reason it felt a lot less epic and not nearly as intriguing or emotional.

The voice acting I found to be stale and dry, from the lack of care in the actors voices to the bland and weary line delivery; one voice actor in particular was Shahadi Wright Joseph as (child) Simba, I found that the performance he gave was really lacking in key areas like emotion and timing.

The characters were basically just the same as the original, so I don't really have much to say here.

The animation may be extremely realistic and detailed, but what angers me most is that because of the realism the animals and characters couldn't express as much emotion as they did in the original film.

The colour scheme was also very dark and grey, which in my opinion takes away from the atmosphere and scale of the film.

The soundtrack was also a huge let down from the original film, from Beyonc√© and Donald Glover's version of Can You Feel the Love Tonight (which takes place in the day) to the addition of Beyonc√©'s song Spirit.

The emotion and relationships in the film were also a lot less gripping, especially the relationship between Simba and Mufasa.

The film I also found to be really bland and uninteresting, but what makes it worse is that the original film was really interesting and had a very strong style to it.

Over all I give it a 
1/10 - would never recommend

498,8a4e0095-d173-457e-ad18-64914f61ea93,Langston,"I liked how they remade and kept original scenes from the cartoon animated film. It truly made you get some nostalgic feelings from watching that opening. I think some of the voice acting was off and the casting couldve been a bit better for at least two characters, but thats most likely just my bias towards the original cinematic film. I also realized they did this for the live action purpose, but I disliked the removal of some iconic scenes and actions from specific characters. Some parts from the 1st movie really added depth to characters and helped the audience really laugh or feel the intensity of a characters thoughts, ideas, plans. Again I know they removed a chunk of these things for live action purposes to fit in with realistic actions, but its hard not to mention either. All in all it was a good reminder of how original The Lion King was back in the day and shows us things that couldve been done differently in some aspects.",2019-08-17T08:43:39.347Z,1.0

But unfortunately there's some not so great things with this movie. A lot of the voice acting felt like I was watching a community theatre play, which is sad because I really like a lot of the voice actors in this movie. While the animation is great and looks realistic, I think it takes away from the performance because the animals aren't allowed to show much emotion. The story in this one felt very rushed and they added some pretty pointless scenes. It feels very lacking and doesn't have near as much heart as the original.",2019-08-17T08:38:03.301Z,0.0

In fact, I'd say most of these Disney remakes were never meant for live-action. They were meant to be animated family fun for everyone.

He wasn't even close to being born when the original came out, but of course he's seen it dozens of times. Now he's a gamer and video maker/editor. He warned me as we were walking in that he might be overly critical but we had both agreed we needed to see it in the theaters before it was gone. Even though we both knew the storyline backwards and forwards we were totally sucked in from beginning to end. There were times that I personally felt anxious, like I didn't know what was going to happen. I'm glad we didn't bring his little sister (7 years-old, but very sensitive) as she would have been scared during several parts. My son and I had both heard not-so-great reviews, so we were on the lookout for negatives but neither of us walked away with any negatives to talk about.

If you got kids you want to introduce Disney films to, the classics are still where to go to.  I will say that this is a better outing than most of what we've gotten so far, mostly because the movie is so alike to the original.  I think the best improvement though is the hyenas are given more of a menacing role than the joke that they were in the original.  On the minus column I think the CGI of the lions faces was subpar, really didn't feel any emotion there.  Zazu as well... hard to watch the way that bird was made, a bit freaky.

670,794142771,Catherine R,"It was ok, but got quickly bored as it lacked the umph of the original movie, largely owing to the disconnect between the characters and their emotions. With them restricted to hyper realism, there was a distinct lack of emotional connection, so Simba looking terrified, sad or overjoyed all looked the same, and often took me out of the moment. Some of the songs also had to be heavily restrained due to hyper-realistic restrictions, such as Scars ""Be Prepared"" song. There were some alterations from the original which were understandable but kind of took the magic out of the film for me.

Maybe because lions are my favorite big ct, or the music and singing added a dimension that overshadowed that flaw, but I loved the movie. The scenery was lush and beautiful for the most part, I found the main characters heartwarming, and the interplay between Simba and his father both loving and stern when he explained the dangers when he disobeyed him were convincing for me.  Of course the comic moments were truly scene stealing. I washappen to hear James Earl Jones as Mufasah and there were mystic qualities with Rafeki, The death of Mufasah was was much more dramatic and darker than the original which I naturally expected and I will admit it, I cried!!! I really enjoyed it and was happy I didn't listen to critics and saw it for myself! I am glad they just rehash the story, but change little things here and there in the approach to the story line which made it fresh. Definitely a Must See!!!!",2019-08-15T05:46:21.801Z,1.0

Changes as in characters and certian props based on realistic standards was honestly really nice to see. Scar was a bit of a flop, but it wasn't the worst remake I've seen. Although the remake was nice to see, it will never top the original.

""real"" animals just don't emote the same way people do which is where i think the animated film has an advantage; animations can bend those rules a bit. don't get me wrong, i still totally cried when Mufasa died, but the rest of it just kind of felt flat.",2019-08-15T01:23:32.399Z,0.0

703,978199037,anonymous  s,"okay, first of all, I would like to say somethings that need to be said about the critics that aren't giving it fair reviews.
First, the reason why games like call of duty and FIFA get high reviews are that a lot of critics are not allowed to make a direct compare to others in a series you can make small parts saying like the characters cannot show emotion like the cartoon but you cannot flat out say the first film better therefor this film was bad.
now on to my review 
_________________________________________________
due to them trying to be realistic it did affect some parts of the movie mostly singing and showing emotion what I mean by this is the singing isn't as clean as you would think the characters sound more like Les Mis where they are more talking through the music and more noise from background fx I don't think many people would like to hear big splash sounds after every step in a song if they are in water oddly it didn't happen in every song just a few 
now with how the characters show emotion oddly, they didn't do a bad job I would say but  some characters have the blank face though the whole movie. They manage to get the lions and hyenas to show a lot more than others.
Shouldn't really need to talk about the story not much change in it 
I would say this movie wasn't the greatest but there wasn't anything bad in it it was a lot more in the middle for me. It isn't a second watch  for me anytime soon but enjoyable I would say

The cinematography is beautiful, the graphics are life-like, but some of the voice acting felt weak.  Donald Glover was great, James Earl Jones is great as we can expect, but I felt Ejiofor, while an incredible actor I've loved in other flicks, didn't have the level of menace Scar held in the original.  This being said, I think the change to Be Prepared, being made like a pre-battle speech for war was genius and Ejiofor NAILS that particular part.  The additional characters for Simba's time growing up with Timon and Pumba felt unnecessary, and some of the changes to Rafiki's part before Simba sees ""who he is"" felt less engaging than the animated original - but honestly all of this is nit-picking.  I enjoy the film and it felt worth the price of admission.",2019-08-14T16:40:47.483Z,1.0

I'm not sure whether it was just me, but i felt that some of the voice acting was a little stale, having little emotion behind its performance.  Additionally the CGI made for fantastic models of animals but failed in giving them facial expressions.  This seemed to make the events of the film (which we're all familiar with) feel like they had less of an impact on the characters.  Overall it was still true to the lion king original in its writing and direction, but felt a little uninspired.

824,790384741,Samantha L,"The animation was beautiful, the score (Other than Beyonce's added track) was phenomenal, however the voice acting was something left to be desired. By creating this photo-realistic version you are losing out on the emotion that hand-drawn animation offers, I believe in order to make up for this some real emphasis on the voice acting was needed. The voice acting was bland, dry, and did not make up for the lack of emotion realistic characters needed. I would take the original voice acting, put it over top since its almost scene for scene, and cut out the unnecessary bits (Like Scar basically becoming an incel because Sarabi chose Mufasa over him) And you would have a perfect, photo-realistic carbon copy. 

This truly lacked the depth and emotion the original had, and I blame it all on the lack of emotion in these characters voices; (Even James Earl's voice lacked the depth he had in the original.) ",2019-08-13T20:32:57.836Z,0.0

831,900740500,Jason M,"	Lion King
	Initial Reaction: How is this going to be different than the cartoon version?
	Main Characters
	Simba, Nala: Two lions voiced by Donald Glover and Beyonce
	TImon, Pumbaa: A meerkat/warthog combo voiced by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen

	Plot Summary (for those who didn't see the animated film)
	Lions rule the land where the movie takes place.  The king and queen just brought in their newest baby, Simba.
	But their brother (or brother in law),Scar (with a name like that, how can he NOT be evil?), schemes to get the throne.  Using the help of the hyenas, he gets the kign killed and Simba ousted out of the kingdom.
	But the lion cub gets some help from a warthog and a meerkat, then the spirit of his dead father, then his ""friend"", Nala.

SCORING
	Main Characters
	The main characters most of us know and love are here and they are just as good and we remember them.  SCORE: 9

	Supporting Cast
	They give Nala a bit more personality because, well, she's the leading lady.  Still, we get some good moments from a baboon, a bird and the hyenas themselves.  SCORE: 8

	Plot
	The plot is easy to follow, and it has a few nice twists.  But they add a few new scenes that felt more like padding.  SCORE: 6

	Originality
	This particular Disney remake does the least changes to the animated version ‚Äì which makes me wonder why make the live action in the first place (other than to show off some impressive CGI.  SCORE: 3

	Violence Factor
	There's a lot of fights between lions and hyenas (I thought I was watching a nature documentary during those fights).  But the fights do get a tiring.  SCORE: 7

	Other Moral Issues
	This film does a great job of showing how to take responsibility for your actions and how to overcome obstacles and situations.  But it does go overboard with the girl empowerment bit.  SCORE: 8

	Final Score (out of 60): 41		% Score: 68.33%
	It's a good film ‚Äì if you haven't seen the animated version.  But it doesn't do much to make it stand apart from that version. 	",2019-08-13T19:49:16.624Z,1.0

897,788075726,Jack W,"Found this computer-generated remake to be an entertaining on the whole with a few caveats.

The movie looks so amazing and photo-realistic. The background in particular is really impressive, I'm surprised this film had only one real setting shot. You really can't tell the difference between this landscape and the real world. Director John Favreau (Iron Man; Jungle Book) has some interesting shots in this. At times, the movie feels like a nature documentary.

Plotwise, this is probably the least ambitious of the recent Disney remakes. Unlike Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, which clung to the plot structure of the originals but also added new elements, this one just retells the basic story. Still, I'm not hating it. This isn't the 90's Psycho. It's not word-by-word. What works for me here is that the jokes are almost all new and they work really well.

Cast is decent. All the funny characters jive. Donald Glover as adult Simba and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar do a good job as the hero and villain. However, Beyonce as adult Nala sometimes really comes across as reading off the page without a whole lot of effort.

The background music really sells the scenes, but admittedly Hans Zimmer basically just rehashes the music from the first film.

This contains all the classic songs from the original. However, ""Be Prepared"" has been changed to a half-it's-length spoken word song with reworked lyrics. I know at one point the news was that they were cutting this song. (Either for time or Ejiofor just didn't have the pipes.) I'm guessing this was added back due to the backlash but modified to accomodate either or both of the potential issues just mentioned. I actually would've preferred if they left the song out rather than going with this neutered version, which doesn't quite work.

If you feel that the recent Disney remakes are soulless cashgrabs, this really won't be the one to change your mind. Despite coasting with the story, I personally found this to be engaging.",2019-08-13T04:16:51.748Z,1.0

910,63AF9107-A879-46EF-A149-1047290F4262,Jonathan D,"Soooooo Lion King. Yeaaaaaa. I've got a rant with spoilers in the event that you've never seen the original. There's your warning....

The Lion King remake. What can I say about this movie other than it was super incredibly disappointing. More disappointing than any remake of anything in recent memory. 

Here's what is great. The casting was suuuuuuuuuper fantastic. Everyone sounded like the original cast. Whether that is intentional or just a happy circumstance, I don't care. Well done. Visuals? Impressive as ever. It looked how I imagine the Serengeti would look. Music? Also, well done. Very well done. With the exception of 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight?' We get it Beyonce. You have some pipes. You're still trash and I don't care what anyone says. Your music sucks and you almost destroy a song because you clearly want people to know you're a singer. FUCK OFF!

All right. Now that I've got the great stuff out of the way you're probably thinking I had a typo when I said it was disappointing. I didn't. Despite all of those things, it was missing the most important piece of what made this movie such a classic...EMOTION! There was no emotion displayed from any of these creatures during any given moment. The quintessential scene of Simba trying to get his dead father up should've gotten me, a 30 year old man, to bawl my eyes out on my tears. Not. One. Shred. Of. Sadness. The cartoon makes me misty eyed to this day. That's not a lie. This hyper realism should've done that and more. It didn't. 

Also, there were changes with certain scenes' dialogue that should never have been changed. The scene of Simba speaking to the spectre of Mufasa. Such a POWERFUL scene in the cartoon. Mufasa tells his son that he has lost himself. Moreover, because he lost himself he had therefore forgotten about his father, whom he (Simba) claims to love. It was a powerful scene that really enlightened Simba to the realization of the consequences of him trying to hide from what has happened and to hide from who really is. What did the remake do? Tell Simba that he needed to reclaim his place on the throne so he can reclaim his place in the Circle of Life. While not terrible, IT MISSES THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF CHARACTERIZATION FOR SIMBA. 

Jon Favreau is undoubtedly talented. I love Iron Man 1 obviously. The Jungle Book remake was perfect. While certain things were changed, they were changed well. THe Lion King is not an example of this. I had no emotional connection to ANY of these characters. I should have come out of this movie on CLOUD FUCKING 9 because of how much this movie means to me. Both, with the joy it brought to me as a youth and with an appreciation of the story being told when I reached adulthood. It saddens me. The cartoon is the best way to see this movie, undoubtedly. You can see the emotion of all the characters. The joy, the sadness, the disdain, the anger, everything. You don't get this with the remake. 1.75/5. I am truly sad to say this :(",2019-08-13T01:55:32.874Z,0.0

I‚Äôm fully with the fans on this and score the movie a solid 83. Would be higher but Beyonce put a damper on things. She‚Äôs too much. Her macho girl routine is over the top and cheesy. ,2019-08-12T19:17:26.586Z,1.0

1061,978195777,Sharlene G,"As much as I love Disney, this whole film just seemed off to me

I felt like I was watching a nature documentary that someone had added a voice over (but not well). It's like the voices didn't really gel with the creatures, and the audio levels never seemed to balance properly (sometimes too loud for the scene, other times too quiet, eg the character would be forefront but sound like they were in the distance, and in the distance but sound like they were beside you).
 
The characters were amazingly realistic....to the point that they were basically emotionless and therefore I didn't feel any connection with them.

Also...I know she's ""queen B"", but Beyonce really needs to learn that, in a duet, there's no lead - both voices need to blend together in unison. Instead, I felt like she was determined for her voice to be the star. In contrast, they made it a humour point when the actual star started riffing, which was clever, but then they were fine to have the supporting cast vocals over-power the lead..?

I was so looking forward to this film, but now that I've seen it, it's actually made me less excited for any of the future live action releases.",2019-08-12T01:43:28.259Z,0.0

While they rightly portray a world of over-hunting large prey animals as unsustainable for predators, they counter that with presenting Paradise as a grub-eating world which couldn't support the large predators at all.  

Lion King II doesn't really improve the position.  It inserts this preachy ""straight line theory"" that shames the grub eaters as oblivious to the idea that everything is connected, While Still Presenting Their World As Paradise.  And making the animal-people ultra realistic only serves to make the idea of eating them even more difficult.

Beyond this, lots of beautiful scenery, cute animals, drama, humor and music.  The message is messy and overall it's not as good as the original except for the extraordinary beauty of it, but not an unpleasant way to spend a few hours, either.",2019-08-11T20:56:12.128Z,0.0

The movie is absolutely stunning to look at from start to finnish, nothing short but fantastic cinematography. The songs are all great, and amazing to watch on the big screen, my only complaint is the shortness of the song ""Be prepared""which could have been the single greatest song in the movie, but didn't quite make it, and it was Disney's fault for wanting it to be as different as possible from the original masterpiece. Yes, the emotions aren't displayed as greatly as in the original, but that's a given, and the voice acting and the phenomenal music accompanying the scenes make up for it. It would be a shame not to watch this movie, it truly is a great film, and watching the final battle between Scar and Simba, and watching all those great cinematic moments, such as 'circle of life' and surprisingly enough 'can you feel the love tonight' and my personal favourite 'can't wait to be king' is absolutely worth it.

There is a lack of any facial expression in the characters, as well as Zazu, Timon and Pumbaa look horrible. The characters are good, but that's only because it copied exactly what the original did, and unlike the original movie, the voice acting was pretty meh, exepect for Scar's voice who genuinely sucked. The songs are pretty awkward, as the musical ""numbers"" are just the characters running and don't even get me started on how cringe-worthy was ""Be Prepared"" here. It doesn't help that the voice actors (Beyonc√® aside) can't sing either.

4) two questions Simba was bipolar who changed his attitude in two seconds?  And if Nala knew where Simba was times ago, why didn't she go before him?

5) Cutting classic scenes and soundtrack and more like giving prominence to Beyonce.  Headup Beyonce is not an actress is a singer who is overrated and all aspects.

1211,977307019,ANDREY A,"Thrilling as the original and visually beautiful, perfect and flawless, 2019's The Lion King is a film with a stylish direction by Jon Favreau, a screenplay by Jeff Nathanson that adapts very well the original, a very talented voice cast, a soundtrack by Hans Zimmer again incredible and a beautiful cinematography by Caleb Deschanel. Also, in my opinion, it's the third best movie of 2019, behind Avengers: Endgame and Toy Story 4 (which take first place together) and Spider-Man: Far From Home and it's another Disney hit in remakes being the best for me",2019-08-11T00:21:16.167Z,1.0

That's the big question that will be on most audience members minds when going to see the (supposedly) live action adaptation of the masterpiece which is the lion king. Just like the great quantity of remakes from Disney classics that have been released before it this movie relies greatly on nostalgia. Although many people would say this is an awful way to further the art which is feature film making. It does work and I found my self enjoying this film throughout, with great songs, voice work and the most photorealistic environment I've ever seen. Without ever felling like a so-called cash grab which we all know it to be. Unfortunately, it does make people think that the geniuses that worked on the original film aren't appreciated as they should be. It's as if people are taking credit for work they did years ago. But if you come into this film hoping for a beautiful, fun experience which reminds you of how great this company is then you will be more than happy. ",2019-08-10T22:44:01.736Z,1.0

This was by far the worst reenactment of a movie I've seen so far. The movie lacked all the things that made Lion King so special. Disney needs to stop remaking movies and work to find creativity that once drove Disney again. This is sad. All the remakes that are coming out only to tarnish the original movie.

All that computer power couldn't save the bad creative decisions from the director. He was so adamant about photorealism that he didn't stop to think about the lack of expressions the characters had throughout the movie.

I hope they release a remastered sometime in the future, one with actual face animation.

Beyonc√© did not having any heart or passion for her character and she was too overpowering in the duets, she wanted to be heard and it ruined them.

The visuals were incredible. Truly, it was difficult most of the time to tell where real turned into graphics. 

I feel bad even writing this because I do kind of cringe when things not related to a movie are brought in as a measure. That being said, I can't dismiss some of the small quirky moments of the animated film that really made it endearing. 

Whoopi's Mufasa shiver...I don't know how you would replicate it but that changes the whole atmosphere of the Hyenas. Simba getting knocked on the head. Classic moments. 

Simba's return seemed less impactful in this version. Didn't feel the struggle and importance of that decision like in the animated version. 

I didn't care for Donald Glover's rendition of Simba. One of the things about James Earl Jones is that is voice is so clear, he annunciates every syllable, he delivers with a fervent performance, he has power, clarity, and meaning. I didn't feel that with Mr. Glover. Fair comparison to anyone? Not really, but I didn't feel anything for his performance here. I feel really bad for anyone who has to sing opposite Beyonce. Even most professional recording artists. 

Overall it just fell flat.  ",2019-08-10T04:48:37.363Z,0.0

1336,978093617,Austin M,"It lacked the emotion of the original and did not add enough new things to make it its own version.
The CGI looks pretty damn good but the fact it is using the look of real animals makes none of the characters show any emotion on their faces when they need it. With that thought, the voice work for those hard emotional scenes wasn't there either, Mufasa's death felt less impact full due to the actors lines not hitting right.
Some scenes were not emphasized on enough while others to much, such as the opening where we follow the little mouse, we dont need to follow it for a whole minute and a half, it adds nothing to the picture. While on the other hand the whole ""Be Prepared"" song number was basically gutted from the film and replaced with the last few lines being ""Talk Sung"" by Scar, another scene taken out, and probably one of the most important, being the scene where Rafiki gives his words of wisdom about learning from the past.

In the end it is just a cash grab because people will go see these films no matter what, but I have a feeling none will be very good, let alone surpass the original Disney pictures",2019-08-09T22:36:42.523Z,0.0

1367,978192496,Donald D,"Honestly, it was alright. It wasn't special, it didn't flare, and it honestly was just kind of bleh. I hated the change of Scar's song. It just fell completely flat--and it used to be one of Disney's best villain songs. It had no emotion, no power, and no intrigue. 

I think the photorealism of the movie really hurt. It caused all the emotion to be lost, all the theatricals to not be done, and all the character development to fall flat. It honestly was not really a good movie, except for the fact that I remember what the original was.",2019-08-09T17:08:43.531Z,0.0

When you have an epic tale like Lion King, you cant just let it play out without an added point of interest either in the storyline or the characters.   I found the characters rather bland. Simba is not really resolving his feelings of guilt and the Hakuna Matata song does little to get the message across that a positive outlook can change anything.  Scar is given more screen time than necessary and the final battle between Simba and Scar goes on for far too long.  In fact long enough for my 12 year old grandson to start fidgeting and checking his watch to see when the end would come.  Nala is forgettable and so are most of the other characters with perhaps the exception of Zazu, the dodo bird.

I understand their focus on trying to remain true to the cartoon, yet still make it its own movie and I think it was a fail. GREAT job on Aladdin, poor job on Loin King. Hopefully they stop here like they did with Aladdin. Which by the way I was very sad about. I would enjoy another Aladdin 2. I didn‚Äôt like the voices for all the characters except for mufasa and rafiki. Beyonc√© was ok a nala and I understand the idea of going with similar but yet different but it was a stretch. The lack of animal emotion was tough. I can imagine it being tough to make the movie move and act like real animals. I mean do animals really know how to laugh and joke and look said and show pain but that movie is one that needed it and lacked alittle. I do really appreciate james earl jones being able to be Mufasa. That‚Äôs a role only he could do. Would I go see it again. Definitely not.

1508,978191492,Distracted _,I think it's a fun and inducing movie and a great remaster if the original Lion King. I like how Disney is remaking their old classics to appeal to the new generation of our audiences. I think they did a good job on the animation and almost all the animals looked realistic. One complaint I do have though is the audio. Disney used the original audio from the first movie which I think is a good choice it's just that Disney didn't remaster the audio. At some points it sounds like the audio was recorded on a $10 microphone rather than the new high-quality mics. The lip-syncing with the animation sometimes doesn't look good. I'm surprised that that happened because Disney is known for their masterful animation and how they try to make their movies as perfect as possible. Overall I think it's a good movie and I would recommend it to anyone in ages 7-mid 20s.,2019-08-08T19:25:26.318Z,1.0

I can't stop feeling like the new nerative is more realistic, which kills the original plot. I think if Disney wanted to make a realistic movie about lions. they shoud have named it something else instead of trying to make money on The Lion King's brand. this movie is just not memorable like the original. Even my kids liked the original better, after watching both they picked the original. I getting tired of all these remakes there is nothing original coming in movies any more! the last memory of a badass movie I have is Avatar, which is getting a second movie.

It was beautiful, yes, but I was expecting some new surprises. The only thing that was really different was Spirit and it was just added to a scene that already existed. Actually, it wasnt as good because the realistic animation did not convey emotion like the animated version did. It was like a nature documentary with the original script over it. Also, Donald Glover cannot hold a note to save his life! Young Simba had a beautiful voice and once he grew up, it was like someone pressed the downgrade button too many times. Beyonc really carried the team in Can you Feel the Love Tonight. I wished there was more new surprises but at the end of the day, its the exact same as the original.

I will say that Chiwetel Efijor did a great job with Scar in this version, though it was less camp and more Shakespearean in comparison with the original. Im glad that James Earl Jones was able to reprise his role as Mufasa but was surprisingly underwhelmed by his performance. Not sure if it has to do with his advanced age now (88) but all things considered, I cant imagine anyone else playing that role. Billy Eichner & Seth Rogen did what they could as Timon & Pumbaa with some genuinely funny parts (especially the hilarious shout out to another Disney classic near the end). Would I see it again?

Growing up that was like my favorite villain song in all of Disney and they just took it all out. That was frustrating. Also at the end when timon did a beauty and the beast reference... that was horrible. You don‚Äôt reference another movie inside a make believe movie.

1624,977962087,Paul D,"My kiddos and I thoroughly enjoyed this film, which we saw in the theater (though we opted against the 3d version).  There is no question that the special effects look real, as though there are live animals speaking and interacting with each other.  The kids particularly liked the comic routine of Pumba and Timon (yes, especially the farting!), and their various forest friends.  But what struck me about this movie was the extraordinary precision with which it hewed to the plot of its animated predecessor, with characters, scene, and sequence virtually identical (as well as the songs, which is understandable; and, I think, even the dialogue).  I'm going to look out for the extent to which other Disney live-action successors replicate their canonical referents.  It's probably best to interpret the virtual duplication as testimony to the power and interest of the original animated version and its new digital doppelganger.",2019-08-08T05:26:29.342Z,1.0

The only thing I found annoying was Nalad southern accent. It was a marked difference from that of the actor voicing Simba. Speaking with an accent from an African country might have been good, with an American midwestern accent or British. If the directors wanted southern, then all speaking parts should have been with that accent.

Really, there is a lot to admire about the movie, but still it can't escape the shadow of the original.  The weird thing is despite being longer a lot of times it feels like it's rushing through the beats of the original.  Most notably, Mufasa's death scene (spoiler's I guess) feels weirdly rushed.  I remember in the original there was time dwelling on Simba looking at the body and begging for Mufasa to get up.  Here, he just kinda looks at it, sniffles a bit, and the scene moves on.  Look I'm not saying it needs to be a shot for shot remake, but if you are going to go through the effort of doing the exact same scenes, either do them better, or do them at least as good, don't just rush through them to check off a box.  That's this films biggest flaw, and it really did bother me.  It lives under the shadow of the original often doing things because ""the original did it"" without really seeming to have an understanding of why that worked in the original.  It was different artists with different visions.  However, when it's doing it's own thing, it actually kinda' works.  A lots been made of Timon and Pumbaa in this movie, and rightfully so, they're one of the few things that is expanded and made to live on their own.  They're essentially the same sort of characters, but Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen bring their own personality to them.  They were allowed to improvise and give their own spin with new lines and humor.  They even have a new philosophy and debate on Hakuna Matata versus Circle of Life that's actually genuinely interesting.  I also liked how their home is inhabited by other animals and it shows how Simba became part of that community in his exile.  It's expansions like this where the film does its own thing where it really shines.  Yes the visuals are nice, but the animals don't show the personality like they did in the animation because Lions can't cry/smile/laugh in real life so what were left with is a really pretty Disney Nature CGI-fest.

Plus. All of the classic songs were flattened with, ""Glee"" levels of autotune. 

And to add insult to a classic scene. .  the iconic, ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" scene, was played out in broad daylight; with Beyonce unleashing unbridled vocal runs over the classic song.  . A hot mess.

An uncanny remake.

Don't get me wrong the effects in this movie were fantastic but it doesn't mean anything if I don't feel anything from seeing it. The theme of the movie was lost by the long transitions from scene to scene by Disney trying to show off their technical skills. Therefore, the feeling and emotion evoked from the faces and surroundings of the original Lion King were completely lost.

The voice acting felt like stone-cold script reading, the visuals, though impressive in technology, felt bland and lacking, and the emotion & heart of what the movie stood for is gone. Even James Earl Jones's return as Mufasa felt like he lost his power as a lion. Besides very few changes, because they were ""new,"" it's all the same exact story. Animation gives a chance to bring expression and life and creativity. You could watch a nature documentary about the Safari, slap a Lion King label and it would be better than this.

1804,978189805,Kai H,"The visuals in this movie are impressive. The photo realism is astounding, but that's not all this movie should've been. The story was a copy and paste of the original, much like a video game remake. The voice acting was subpar at some points. Some of the most influential scenes (Mufasas death, Scars musical number, Hakuna Matata) were dull and lifeless BECAUSE of the photo realism. The characters can't emote properly so some of the body movements are exaggerated, but then it gives the characters an uncanny valley vibe. One of the best Disney villain songs in my opinion was completely scraped and only had a hint of the original song towards the very end, but even then it wasn't there. Because this is photorealistic, there's no creativity. What should've been inspiration, was just there to be a template to animate over. The lack of facial expressions kills this whole movie. When Simba sees his father dead on the gorge floor in the original, he is so expressive and it makes you feel what Simba is feeling in that moment. In the remake, all of that emotion is lost. No expression, no emotion. If they were making this for a bunch of lions, I'm sure they'd be thankful for the accuracy, but the movie isn't for LIONS it's for HUMANS. Humans rely on facial emotion to properly understand what's happening. Animals (especially felines) don't. They rely on body language. But a lot of people can't read animals. That's why cats are seen as aloof and uncaring. Their owners can't read them. If people aren't able to read real life animals, how are they supposed to read the body language of an imitated animal? So many influential scenes were removed and so many tedious and useless characters were added (ie the animals in the jungle) all for the sake of a joke or a sixty second song. The scene with Mufasas ghost in the clouds was barely recognizable for me in theaters because all I saw was a bunch of clouds with the occasional lightning. When you take one of the worlds most known films and attempt a remake, you should improve on it. Don't try to change the formula. Leave some realistic elements in, but don't try to make it look like I just spent twenty bucks on a movie ticket to watch a National Geographic documentary. This movie was lifeless and a copy paste, but with better graphics. ",2019-08-07T07:44:03.555Z,0.0

Ive seen the original and I thought this was a great movie. My family enjoyed it. The so called critics are being over sensitive and harsh on the movie. It was beautiful, fun and had moments that were sad, funny, empowering... Look at it as a new film and sit back and enjoy, dont compare every scene to the original. It is entertaining if you want to take your family to a good film. The same people that give it 1 star will give a terrible movie 5 stars so give it a chance.

While they have shorter more rushed dialoged in other scene. There is one noted new scene where you see Nala leave pride rock and some add time with Simba, Timon and Pumbaa. If you where thinking with the extra run time they would add more heart and soul the characters backround and story they don't. The songs do not even come close to the original. 'Cant wait to be king' is  just okay at best, they don't even try with Scar 'be prepared', and 'can you feel the love tonight' is just there. ",2019-08-07T02:48:50.550Z,0.0

First of all, it drags on, there is a 40-50 minute long introduction that leads to the climax of the plot, and that is boring to death. Second, the animals are not anatomically accurate. Disney castrated them all, because God forbid kids see reproductive organs (eyeroll). Third, there is a lot of violence, very inappropriate for a family movie. Fourth, the singing is too theatrical, too over the top. So, that's the list of problems I saw in this movie. A very well-executed mess.",2019-08-07T01:25:45.781Z,0.0

Chiwetel Ejiofor's Scar seems more low-key (and menacing) than Alan Rickman's version, while the returning voice work of James Earl Jones as Mufasa was a welcome link to the original version.  The majority of the rest of the primary cast, including Donald Glover (Simba) and Alfre Woodard (Sarabi) is fine )maybe a bit underused), but the chemistry between Beyonce's Nala and Simba seemed off...

If you liked the original (unless you are a complete purist) you will find the ""live-action"" version of the Lion King an enjoyable show.  The new visuals are stunning, even if the story itself is not improved upon.",2019-08-06T22:50:47.234Z,1.0

This movie has its moments of nostalgia, and the musical numbers are still effective, but as with Aladdin it just doesn't have anything new to say. Which is the problem because the animated originals still hold up as classics, compared to these beat-for-beat remakes, that don't justify their existence.  ",2019-08-06T22:39:47.704Z,0.0

What was missing: Dispite stunning graphics it was odd, even creepy to watch seemingly lifelike character emotionless and apparently not even breathing. To clarify, the animals only movement was a result of the animators trying to capture the effects of wind hitting their bodies or their movement from one position to the next. The act of breathing which everyone creature does at rest or in motion was only present in the field mouse and possibly 2 or 3 times in Simba. The creatures almost emotionless features left a great deal to the character actors to create in tone of their voices. 

So this movie sadly rated 3 stars since I expected much more. Hard to believe a cartoon version back in 1994 told the story better and demanded more emotional presence that all viewers were in tears. It would have been an even trade-off if the 2019 version kept the same script word for word, atleast that way the viewers could resite scenes along with the movie.",2019-08-06T22:33:41.124Z,0.0

1939,978189197,Kelsey G,"I think a lot of critics and people are understanding this movie completely wrong. Quite frankly, it's very disappointing that a proclaimed movie critic would give this movie such a low rating. For one, this movie is NOT to be compared to the original. Lions with facial expressions make it very appealing to the younger audience. However, this movie is life changing and a huge leap in the movie industry. Of course, they won't give a virtually real looking lion eyebrows that leave their face. It is up to the audience to listen and experience in order to get a feel for what this movie is expressing. Yes, that means use your own imagination. The Lion King has opened so many doors and it's hard to think of an new animated movie that could possible beat this one. Everything was fantastic. A lot of critics will say that they left out important messages that the original movie inputted. However, by watching, laughing, sympathizing, and gaining a connection through this experience does anything but lack those messages. It is truly a masterpiece and I will watch it over and over again with the same mind blowing expression on my face.",2019-08-06T19:56:43.030Z,1.0

Once this movie ended, one of my friends leaned over to me and said, ‚ÄúWELL THAT WAS A LIFELESS CORPSE OF A MOVIE.‚Äù Honestly, he‚Äôs not that far off.

This remake is ‚Äúlive action‚Äù, which ironically takes the life out of it. üòÇ It feels like a computer made this movie, both literally and metaphorically! ü§£ 
Donald Glover plays Simba, and I‚Äôm sorry, I LOVE Glover, but he is so miscast. Honestly, all the voice actors sounds so uninterested & tired, it sounds like they all took half a bottle of NyQuil before recording. üòù

Some things don‚Äôt work in live action. These animals seem so robotic, & there‚Äôs no emotion on any of their faces! üòê I think a brick wall had more emotion than these f*cking characters‚Äô faces. üòÇ .

All these Disney remakes are the same, goddamnit! They‚Äôre all wildly MEDIOCRE, with little charm or life to them, and only exist to show off pretty visuals and to make money lazily.

The voice over of the animals made it seem more fake than anything, and seriously,¬† this was an animated movie in 1994 there was really a lack of expression and character from start to finish. If disney¬† is going to remake such an iconic movie such as The Lion King at least try and make it decent and not like a children's documentary movie with poorly talking animals and dull expressions.

I felt the burning need to jump up and make out with Donald Glover's Simba more often than I care to admit. That shit was w-e-t. They managed to squeeze a little heaven, a.k.a Beyonc√©, in there, while the annoying Brit, John Oliver, plays the annoying British bird. So give that casting director a raise! The soundtrack? More cinematic than it was before because the only thing better than percussion is more percussion. The story? Unchanged, but ain't nothin' higher than #1, to quote Beyonc√©'s husband. Timon and Pumbaa have new jokes, Chiwetel Ejiofor tries to sing ""Be Prepared,"" bless him, while James Earl Jones and Mufasa officially become one light. I am missing Nala's smug feminist journey, Simba's Transformation is too dialed in like a 1-900 number, and if you're gonna hire John Kani to play the red-assed Rafiki you give the man some more work because he's everything.

Voice acting was iffy in some place, such as young Simba seeming watered down as opposed to his cartoon counterpart.

You forget that the animals can‚Äôt really talk bc they do so good at making them look like they are really talking. Know that it is exactly like what you would think if you have seen the Disney original, lots of loud action, could be scary for little ones. I would not recommend for kids under age 5 (?).

This might be sacrilege, but I never saw the original, so I can't compare.

The visuals were really outstanding and mesmerizing.  There were times I struggled to tell if it was real or not.  

In terms of the actors, I thought Seth Rogan was pretty strong.  Beyonce was my second favorite.  Donald Glover (as Simba) was OK but didn't really stand out to me.

Overall I enjoyed it.

The cgi visually was amazing, it really felt like you were watching a documentary.That being said i felt the realism was what let the film down, missing the facial expressions and emotions from the original.

The music of course is what made the lion king great ! But again you can't not compare it to the original which of course is better .

Apparently there was 30 minutes more added to this remake which I rarely noticed when watching the film except for when they threw in a bit of Beyonc√© just to fit in her new song .

Overall kids that are just being introduced to Disney will love it and the adults going with them will enjoy the nostalgia factor that made them love the original.

It was a fresh take that allowed me as the viewer to be emotionally invested and not be distracted by the goofiness of cartonny storyboards as when this story was told in the 90's.
 The voice actors did their jobs , withh Seth Rogen and Beyonce standing out amongst the cast, and The Neptunes & Elton John did spectacular remixes to a soundtrack that never knew it needed a touch up.
There was a comic book adaptation of this that enjoyed reading above all retellings of this story , but Favreau's reboot of this stroy is in a class of it's own by sheer visual effects alone so much so that all interpretations of this film that came before don't even deserve to be put in comparison.

2278,260014011,,"I don't understand why they took out so many good things about the original movie. That plus, rushed dialouge, (felt like they (even James Earl Jones!) were reading a script for some of the old good dialouge) too loud music during a couple major dialouge scenes, way too much screen time for the mouse Scar was planning to eat and Simba's hair floating to Rafiki. And how did he know it was Simba's? It had touched water, a giraffe's tongue and dirt; I don't know how it would have still held Simba's scent. And it's just a piece of hair, not his hair all over the grass and flowers like in the original. How did he know who it was just by a look? Nala also recognized Simba way too fast! And though the lions were real-looking and beautiful, it took away from the emotion. Young Simba's crying and yet I see no tears and see no sadness on his face, so it took away from some of the emotional scenes. Minor note but Mufasa roared on the cliff scene. I preferred the original where his scream and roar was combined when Scar clawed him. It was also hard to tell the difference between Sarabi and Nala. A couple minor changes, a couple added lines to Scar and Timon and Pumbaa were good, but nothing spectacular. I couldn't see Mufasa in the sky. With all the special effects, I thought that would have been at least like the original, maybe better. Rafiki calls his stick his old friend, yet we never saw it in the beginning. He wasn't funny and silly, and he kept speaking in a different language which was confusing and not needed. And they took out him hitting Simba on the head! That was needed for Simba to change his mind and had a great moral lesson! And last but not least, they cut Be Prepared, one of the best songs ever made by Disney!! I understand why they did because the original is condescending to the hyena pack and they were a lot creepier and more aggressive in this version. But they could have done the song so much better. They shouldn't have even bothered making it if they were gonna do it like this. No need. Usually Disney does a great job, (like Aladdin. Those changes made sense and it was really live action, real people!) but unfortunately, they didn't live up to the original, not even close. ",2019-08-05T13:26:54.632Z,0.0

The story is classic and never gets old. My only true dislike for the movie was the voice acting. Beyonc√© voice pulled me away from the move, her voice is to recognizable and she didn‚Äôt try to mask or change it, so every time she had a line it felt like I was listening to Beyonc√© and not Nala....it was the same with Seth rogen and the warthog. When it comes to CGI and animation I think it‚Äôs important to have a voice that‚Äôs not recognizable because you start to reference the voice to the actual person which ruins the movie or at least have the actor mask or change they‚Äôre voice.

2340,978187092,Gabriel V,"I have to say I was never a big fan of the original - I liked and appreciated the film but it wasn't something that I really loved. Having that in mind I wasn't, like most, particularly excited about this remake nor was I expecting anything extraordinary. And I would be lying if I said I wasn't entertained. Yes, the story is completely recycled from the 1994 original almost shot-for-shot but that wasn't a big problem for me. I would recommend seeing this film if only to witness the stunning CGI on display here. It's genuinely photorealistic -  I might as well had been watching a Nat Geo documentary in that theater. I also have to mention the voice work of Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen as Timon & Pumba. The stars of this movie as far as I'm concerned. Perfect casting. The jokes never fall flat and I found myself truly laughing on more than one occasion. Donald Glover suprisingly delivers an underwhelming performance as adult Simba. Almost emotionless most of the time. I was also glad to hear James Earl Jones as Mufasa once again, always great in his iconic role. However, the pacing of the movie felt a bit off, almost as if it was rushed. That made me feel a bit detached from the story and I found myself not really caring much about the characters nor was the ending as cathartic as in the original. It's a 3.5 for me.",2019-08-05T07:09:15.943Z,1.0

The only negative I had was that I missed Whoppi Goldberg and crazy Ed as the hyenas.,2019-08-05T04:07:10.902Z,1.0

I was a little disappointed, with the original being my favorite Disney film. However, the actors who replaced the originals do an amazing job in their characters.

For example you can see the muscle structure in Simba's legs, the hair and facial features in Pumba and the soul in the eyes of Rafiki.  When getting into nitpick territory I would only suggest that Jeremy Irons should have returned in the role of Scar.  That would be the only thing from making this a 5/5.  Many people might complain that the film is just a scene for scene remake of the animated classic, which I'm fine with.

2662,977349922,Ross E,"The benefit this film has is that its following a story that was already good and familiar, so as you're watching, its helps keep the pace moving along as key scenes from the original play out. I wish I could see this movie without that advantage. Would it still carry well? Possibly, it's still a strong story, but I feel the real problem is the lack of emotion in the new portrayals, both in the voices as well as the lack of expression in the faces. Even James Earl Jones sounds tired and bored. Also, with songs as popular as these, every nuance sticks out. Kid Simba is basically lacking in emotion entirely both speaking and singing, new Zazu doesn't even ATTEMPT to be fun and interesting, kid Nala sounds like she's reading off her script, or at best maybe had one chance to read it over before delivering lines. Ugh and Timon and Pumba make Hakuna Matata a cringefest (as was Just can't Wait to be King). It really makes me wonder if these are good songs without the influence of the original. I generally enjoy covers when theyre done well, but I can't help but cringe at these attempts. 

To conclude my review, its only not awful because I'm watching the original in my head and overlaying it over this. Also, butchering Be Prepared wasn't the answer. I'd rather it be gone entirely than have what they did.",2019-08-04T04:18:48.300Z,0.0

2716,956502772,Daniel S,"I'm not usually ever bored in movies, and even if they're bad I can enjoy hating them, but this was just boring and lazy from start to finish.  The CGI looks great, but when the animals look so real it strips the characters of the humanity that can only be expressed in cartoon animation.  Every single moment of this movie was several steps below the original to the point where it was frustrating to watch.  It felt like every actor was phoning it in, even James Earl Jones, who was delivering the same lines as he did before, just worse somehow.  This movie was too long and yet felt like everything was rushed down to a high school first time table-read.  The only good thing about this movie by a long shot was John Oliver as Zazu who did a really good job and I enjoyed any moment he was on screen; perfect for the part.  Scar's voice and lines were by far the most disappointing. I could never think of a situation in which I would watch this instead of the original.",2019-08-04T01:27:48.971Z,0.0

2780,922021352,Matthew S,"It's strictly a worse version of the original. The singing was nice, but whereas the original had a nice vibrant colour scheme and visuals to go along with it, this one just... Didn't. This adds absolutely nothing, also, the guy playing Scar clearly phoned in his performance, at no point coming close to conveying any emotion that wasnt mild disinterest. This wasnt helped by the fact that the CGI just cannot emote. Simba's ""I Just Cant Wait To Be King"" face is exactly the same as his ""Dad, why wont you wake up?"" Face.

This feels like the result of a dare. ""I bet you cant make a shot-for-shot remake of The Lion King in CGI."" And the answer was, yes you can... But it was an entire waste of time.",2019-08-03T21:32:40.950Z,0.0
2781,946628004,Jason B,"While its visuals are stunning and lifelike, the story lacks the emotional impact of its 1994 predecessor. It is literally almost the exact same film with alterations that took away from the heart and soul of what made the animated classic so enjoyable. The characters' faces show no expression while the vibrant colors and backgrounds are replaced with dull and muted colors. In short, it's similar to James Cameron's ""Avatar:"" Praised for its stunning visual achievements but will soon be forgotten because there is nothing else that truly makes it stand out from any of the other films we've seen.

Disney did a fantastic job making the scenes a bit more realistic. James Earl Jones, voices of Rafiki, Zasu, grown Simba, Scar, and surprisingly Nala was very well done. I loved the added song and the beautiful rendition of Can you feel the love tonight. I thought the casting of the cub versions of Simba and Nala as well as Timon and Pumba should have been rethought. The acting was not very good. Singing voices of cub Simba and Nala were beautiful. I couldn‚Äôt help but feel the sound, exciting energy and humor of the original just wasn‚Äôt there. It would have been fun to see more of the original characters come back. I feel it would have made the acting so much better. Ok remake overall.

2861,803945697,Daniel O,"A beautiful ""national geographic"" film that tries and fails to trigger the inner child and long-lasting connection many of us have had with the film. It definitely did not live up to the original.

The original animated film is a classic. A cliche story with great music, fun animations, and even brings a tear to your eye. 

However, the live action feel is way too close to reality. The animals look real, and it makes me feel uncomfortable to see them talk, sing and dance. The songs feel like they were cut short, the classic moments feel forced, and while it did pass the time, I cannot say that I enjoyed it.

There was no way to see emotion (a tear, a smile, etc...) on the faces of the real animals which really took away from the film.",2019-08-03T14:21:50.367Z,0.0

A beautiful master piece carefully crafted. And yet, this version fell so short. Why Disney keeps stomping on the things that we love and care about?

The characters were awful, Simaba is more reckless, weak and scary cat than it was before and Nala is more obnoxious, I used to love Nala because she was the anchor of Simba she was that little support and self awareness that Simba needed, now she's more like an obnoxious whip that never stops. 

In this version most of the comic relieves were removed or changed for something else,  this is disheartening because these scenes were part of the core of the movie, I remember when I was a little kid the hyenas made laugh so hard, here they removed most of their scenes so no laugh anymore. 

The music was great though. I still feel goosebumps when listening to ""Can you feel the love tonight"" and ""The circle of life""; beautiful music in deed, and I believe the movie has some of the best songs a movie can have.

Obviously as a cartoon, you can have as much expression has you want but if you're dealing with real-life visuals, not so much. It didn't bother me personally. I think Billy and Seth Rogan such a great choice to go with. This really made this movie better than it already was. I enjoyed it and I would see it again. ",2019-08-03T03:48:00.907Z,1.0

There's a max of 5 lines that actually add any new experience or meaning. Disney had no need to remake a story that was already so perfect.

3012,928720889,Matt R,"The original Lion King is SACRED to me. It is the movie that represents my childhood. Even now, 25 years later, I still get choked full of emotion watching it. But as I watched the, quote-on-quote ""live-action"" remake, I felt pretty much NOTHING. 

When Mufasa died (SPOILER ALERT), I felt NOTHING. 

When Simba roared to become king, I felt NOTHING. 

The film completely lacks the emotional depth of the original, and we're left with little more than a soulless shot-for-shot remake of the animated masterpiece. Granted, the visuals are spectacular, and the CGI is great, but this is that rare occasion where that is a bad thing. The animals look far too real to express any real form of emotion, which was my biggest concern going into this movie. 

The voice cast is solid, with Seth Rogen (Pumbaa) and Billy Eichner (Timon) stealing the show. They were even nice enough to bring back James Earl Jones to voice Mufasa. Unfortunately, that was the only returning member of the original voice cast, which I feel was a mistake. Chiwetel Ejiofor was an AWFUL replacement for Jeremy Irons as Scar, and the way the movie butchers the song ""Be Prepared"" is simply mind-boggling. The rest of the songs are perhaps the highlight of the film, providing you with a rush of nostalgia, most notably in the ""Circle of Life"" opening. To be honest, that may have actually been my favorite scene in the movie.

Nobody wanted a remake of The Lion King, which was already perfect in its original form. The only reason for this movie's existence is to be a quick cash grab, which Disney has gotten in the form of over a billion dollars and counting. For me, I've officially had enough of these cheaply made live-action remakes. Perhaps these films will resonate with this current generation of kids, and that's OK.

3049,978066423,Cece O,"I originally walked into the theater hoping that I'd get a new take on a childhood classic. I had watched the movie many times as a child for it was my brother's favorite movie, and based on how Disney had rewritten the stories for this new age of live-action remakes (such as Maleficent not being as evil, and the side story in Dumbo) I had high hopes and high expectations. However, Disney did NOT meet up to those expectations. 

First off, the voice acting was not good, most notable in Beyonce's work. While I love Queen Bee, I detested her voice acting, and I'm quite sick of actual talented voice actors being replaced by A-List Celebrities just for the star quality to use in promotions to push out the movie and gain more money. Evidently, Disney values quantity over quality (not that I didn't already know this).

For the movie being a complete remake of the original without any new focus or plot-line, I at least expected it to be better, but it wasn't. The song sequences in the original were dull in the movie due to the lack of vibrant colors and stunning animation, and I was not very fond of the singing either. This was a definite complaint in 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight?' and 'I Just Can't Wait to be King'. There was simply too much riffing for it to be enjoyable (for me at least) and while the singers are talented, I just wasn't into the style of singing compared to Disney's simpler yet powerful music- where the singers shows their prowess in the power of their voice rather than in how much they can riff notes (again, I was mostly annoyed with Beyonce). It turned from a sing-a-long tune to a listen-and-appreciate song, which was not something I wanted from such a staple like 'I Just Can't Wait to be King'. 

Most egregious, however, was the fact that they CUT SCAR'S VILLIAN SONG! IT WAS LIKE THIRTY SECONDS! WTF!? IT MIGHT NOT BE A 'HELLFIRE', BUT IT WAS STILL GOOD, AND THE ANIMATION SEQUENCE FOR IT IN THE ORIGINAL WAS SO AMAZING WITH THE GREEN TINT AND EVERYTHING, UGH!

The only thing that was an improvement was the comic relief characters Timon and Pumbaa, and I wouldn't mind getting a Lion King 1 1/2, as long as they were just as funny.

I suppose the movie would be good for the new generation that can't compare it to the original (but I'd most certainly never let my little cousins watch this before feasting on the beauty that was 1994's Lion King), but for older viewers like me (lol, I'm only seventeen), DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. The original Lion King's on Netflix now, just watch it there.

It is the same old story you loved, the same old songs you sang to, and the same old characters you knew when you were a child. This might be the most straight up, shot for shot, beat for beat adaptation of a Disney classic. What it lacked in inspiration and creativity story-wise, it compensated with a stunning exhibition of the great power of modern CGI. The way the characters talked, sang, and acted didn't bother me despite the negative comments made on the animals' lack of emotions because of the authenticity the creative team wanted the characters to display.

3076,907803058,Kyle M,"If you could think which Disney classic seems to be more of a masterpiece, taking it further on a majestic scale, ""The Lion King"" would arguably come to mind as the most outstanding animated presentation ‚Äì with questionable origin, while Jon Favreau's reimagined ""The Jungle Book"" takes the top podium for the live-action medium. The obvious connection between the two films is Favreau's ambition of exploiting the amazing technological effects that brought ""The Jungle Book"" to life, with blended vie for faithfulness that marks his authorship, and ""The Lion King"", being Disney's Renaissance peak, is another nature film with a legendary stance that makes it a perfect challenge to tackle in another reimagining. The remake does not exactly reach the mighty volume but is without a doubt generally beautiful and honorably triumphant.

""The Lion King"", marking the 25th anniversary of the original majesty, is agreeably inferior but nonetheless great from the scenic imagery masking authentic natural wonders as the definite counterpart form of photorealism to the overall soul consisting the musical score and vocal performances. The kinetic energy between the CGI-created environment and the mostly new cast bringing their connected characters to life is what makes the onscreen appearances as perfect embodiments, indicating how utterly faithful Favreau passionately honored without ruining the formulaic greatness. With a lot of iconic aspects that could not be completely revised nor flipped whilst still the same narrative touch in the flow, he still obliged with the current traditional routine of modernizing meanings, differentiating insights and originated intentions that were more pointed out towards the classic with very little to improve. The story is Shakespearean through ""Hamlet"", and Favreau pushed the story closer to its original source material.

However, the film is mostly criticized for being more of a shot-for-shot remake without adding anything new to the whole story. While that may be true unlike how the past remakes enhanced the experience with updated storytelling and opportune positions for character arcs that were not thought of at the time,  and there are only little expansion in the script's subtle heftiness, it is rather proof that the story can still be told under a new aesthetic with the same enjoyment value ‚Äì like how praiseworthy remakes did when reusing the formula. As the main intention is to honor the story, Favreau explored it dimensionally albeit being at times questionably disruptive in contrast to the original's smoothness, and the effects adds little more depth such as the expressions when emotions are expressed.

One element that pleasantly remains the same between the two is the music with composer Han Zimmer reprising his role in spiritually lifting the story's spirit once again, revitalizing the circle of life. The opening number, presented by the franchise's collaborative performer Lebo M featuring Rafiki theatrical performer Lindiwe Mkhize, gives the film's first impression with an ever-chilling effect as it amplifies the scene ‚Äì and given the background information shows the faithful lengths that were pursued.

The Broadway-equivalent fine cast has lent their voices to the beloved, memorable characters with matching yet refreshing spirit including the update's more modernized tone. James Earl Jones' return as Mufasa is an awesome touch in revisiting the Pride Lands with the mightily classic guidance. The rest of the cast, becoming part of the challenging retelling, did exceptionally well in their performances, with some proudly matching the original voices as a step further of doing their part in honoring the legacy's initial characterization. The only flaw is not making up for agreeing in shorthand to follow the disruptive flow on very few, noticeable occasions.

Jon Favreau triumphs in successfully tackling the ambitious challenge of remaking a classic, while enforcing photorealism as another masking medium for filmic storytelling and again demonstrating faithful lengths in really connecting to the story while honoring it. He did just that in exploring the circle of life in a way he wanted to tell it, despite being more flawed than his previous jungle expedition that was only groundbreaking and additionally hefty. ""The Lion King"" may not roar as mighty nor in a majestic fashion to the king's royal level, the undemanding remake successfully and perfectly naturally replicated the epic power to bolster the entertainment value in being noted as this year's best live-action remake from the brand, with beauty and honor.

Try not to laugh this time around because while Simba's voice actor pulls all the punches, the little lion on screen has so little emotion on his face you'll wonder if HE was the one who died!   --- Dreadful. Honestly a dreadful remake.  What happened, Favreau? What happened??",2019-08-02T16:42:28.098Z,0.0

Then add to all of it the mediocre reviews I'd seen from @petertravers & others that I really align with & you get my reason for holding out a few weeks. Let me start by saying: the movie is amazing to look at & I have no idea how they have perfected digital animation to a point that you can't tell what's real & what's not. I thought until I read otherwise today that the landscapes were all location shots & characters then digitally inserted. I had no idea the entire thing save one shot was digitally rendered. The knocks on it are legit: there's just not as much vibrancy & life as the original. You can't recreate those colorful, coordinated animations digitally. But it makes up for it by bringing to life an awesome story. You forget the animals aren't real. It's remarkable. Probably won't rent or purchase on demand but will watch when it comes on TNT later.

And I'm not only talking about Pumbaa & Timon, it also severely lacked what Cheech Marin & Whoopi Goldberg brought to the hyenas.

3130,260126310,,"The main issue with this movie is that it cannot decide whether it‚Äôs a frame by frame remake, or a serious toned adaptation. It‚Äôs both when it shouldn‚Äôt be. Favreau absolutely nailed the dichotomy of the two styles in Jungle Book and simply failed in Lion King. The Jungle Book has believability when Baloo sings to himself/Mogli while floating the river. King Louis doesn‚Äôt sing when he‚Äôs confronting Mogli and the scene is immensely more terrifying and believable. I wasn‚Äôt scared of Scar when he ‚Äúsang‚Äù Be Prepared. I didn‚Äôt feel whimsical at Can‚Äôt Wait to be King. Honestly the best musical segment was Lion Sleeps tonight because it provided some comical relief and built itself naturally. Speaking of poor music choices, Lion King 2019 had the opportunity to truly marry the beloved animated film with the beloved broadway musical and just...didn‚Äôt. The available soundtrack even has several songs from the broadway show, yet the film does not use them. Instead of ‚ÄúHe Lives in You‚Äù we have Beyonc√© singing ‚Äúspirit‚Äù over and over. Rather than ‚ÄúShadowlands‚Äù, we have...‚ÄùBe Our Guest?‚Äù The Beauty and the Beast reference was completely out of place and really took away from the scene. Lastly, although the animation is beautifully done, Favreau dug his heels in on the realism. The magnificent color pallet and character design/humanism in the original animated film is replaced with emotionless hyper-realistic animals and sets. No longer the rich and dramatically colorful landscapes and emotive characters, but more of the dry earth tones and expressionless animals. Any wildlife documentary does a better job of highlighting Africa‚Äôs immense beauty and diversity. I can understand Favreau‚Äôs desire to cater to the nostalgic audience, but it feels, again, like he couldn‚Äôt decide what movie he wanted to make. Was it a frame by frame remake or was is a serious toned adaptation with small tributes to the source material? Yes. ",2019-08-02T13:30:29.751Z,0.0

3157,849847327,Andy G,"This is tricky to rate. I heard one person explain it very well ""It's like you're enjoying the movie, but also bored at the same time"". I give it points for the visual technology, for the score, for the cinematography, and some of the acting, but overall there's just a feeling that it's lacking the soul it needs, because they decided to make the animation just a little too realistic, where the animals simply are expressionless, and it hurts the movie.

I don't know why they took that approach. It's been proven before that realistic models/lighting/materials can mesh very well with a slightly more cartoony animation. In fact, some of the best animation I've ever seen has been done that way, and this movie would have been improved if they handled things that way. Take a look at Rocket Raccoon for a relevant recent example of a mostly photorealistic animal that animates properly. Even The Jungle Book handled this better. 

It's still mostly an enjoyable experience, because I mean, it's still the Lion King, but with the obvious comparisons you're going to make, even a decently made movie is still going to feel underwhelming compared to a practically flawless original. So yes, my words may seem at odds with my rating, but overall, this was still a well made movie. It just didn't live up to the bar it needed to hit.",2019-08-02T07:55:42.300Z,1.0

3165,971893883,Micah W,"Man... where do I start with this one... I came into this film hearing both good things about the film from friends and bad things from critics, so I tried to keep an open mind, but this one was really quite a disappointment. While I can tell that a lot of hard work was put into this movie, as a whole, it just failed in so many ways. In case you haven't heard, the new Lion King is very closely followed to that of a shot to shot remake. There are some subtle differences to the film, but nearly all of them are much more for worse than for better. While there are some problems I have with the idea of a shot to shot remake, I wouldn't mind it too much if they had kept the heart of the original intact. However, they didn't and that can be broken down into 2 main reasons. 

(1). The Cinematography. What I'm about to say may not make sense at first, but bear with me. I truly believe that some absolutely amazing work was done in terms of the visual effects for this film. So much time and effort was put in from this department and it shows in its realism (even if it does cross into the uncanny valley occasionally). However, despite this fact, the movie is so visually boring. Sure, the visual effects of the film may look realistic, but that doesn't mean they look good from an artistic perspective. Everything is just so dull looking and anticolorful. Sure it looks like I'm watching a documentary, but it's a documentary that contains flat, boring shots that do nothing to show off the beauty of Africa. If you want visuals like that, go watch Planet Earth. That movie is stunning! Compare the visuals of the remake to that of the animated original. Because the original isn't hindered by its ideology that it has to look as realistic as possible, it has the creative freedom to exaggerate. To do things that you just couldn't without it being animated. One scene, in particular, was that of ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"". In the original, as soon as the music hits, the animation changes and the world becomes gorgeously colorful. The whole scene is Simba and Nala interacting with all the animals in fun and creative ways that make for a joyous time. Contrast to the original and its both of them running around the watering hole trying to hide from Zazu. Nothing special. The problem with the choice of making it look like a documentary is that it adds restrictions to the film that the original could ignore and run wild with! The visual style may look realistic for the most part, but that doesn't mean it looks good.

(2).The performances. I have to first off preface this by stating that I in no way believe that any the actors in this film are bad actors. On the contrary, there is a whole lot of voice-talent in this film! However, what we hear is only half of what we get when it comes to performances in a film like this. That other half of the performances was that of the facial expressions. ESPECIALLY the ones pertaining to any of the lion characters. I know this goes back a little to the previous point I made, but the idea of making this film look hyperrealistic hurt this film in so many ways! Because they decided that these lions need to look and act as realistic as possible, they dumbed down their facial expressions to the point that you can barely tell what any of them are thinking. It merely looked like voices dubbed poorly over nature documentary footage. Imagine seeing an actor sound like they are truly crying and balling as they stare at the lifeless body of their father with eyes that only seem mildly upset. That is what watching this film was like. I could never take any of these performances seriously despite the talent behind these voices. Even James Earl Jones sounded bored in this movie!! The only real exceptions to this in the film were from Timon and Pumba. They were hilarious! They were allowed to be different and the animation used for them allowed the expressiveness in their voice to actually come out and shine. 

There were many other problems I had with the film (i.e. theme removal, incredibly rushed scene pacing, ""Be Prepared"" is shortened to a sloppy mess, and WAY too many riffs from Beyonce and Donald Glover), but these two points were the main ones that stuck out to me.",2019-08-02T06:19:58.624Z,0.0

Viewers may or may not enjoy the cartoonish comical feel that is lost when the film has more of a dramatic and slightly stoic flow. It was hard to make a connection to this beloved classic probably because of my endearment to the cartoon. I most likely would have given this five stars if I had not ever seen the former.

Definitely give it a watch and see what you think!",2019-08-01T19:59:30.191Z,1.0

Rafiki didn‚Äôt even have his stick and never hit Simba with it COME ON..... the you would think the people that they cast for the hyenas would at least try to improvise something funnier than the final product that was presented. The only thing that was funny was PERSONAL SPACE. No crazy Ed, no Cactus butt, no chewing on their own leg, NOTHING.

3356,978151978,jessica b,The newest live action Disney remake is a good one. The original lion king is an absolute classic that most adults have grown up with including me so like most people I was very sceptical of this remake however I did very much enjoy it. it stays true to the original and has very few changes which is both a good and a bad thing. the voice acting is fantastic Seth Rogan steals the show has Pumbaa and Beyonc√© is incredible the rest are all great as well. the songs are just as memorable as they were in the original and I especially loved the new version of I just cant wait to be king. the death scene of Mufasa still hit me very deeply and I did cry watching it in the theatre. the visuals are breathtaking and flawless everything looks real and its extremely impressive. the score is powerful and incredible and even better than in the animated movie. like I said before this remake has very few changes and I wish they would have taken more chances with it and made it a bit different instead of doing an almost shot for shot remake. overall if your going to watch the lion king watch the original but this one is good and enjoyable.,2019-08-01T17:12:27.374Z,1.0

Their laughs and how stupidly funny they were in the animated version there was nothing like that in this re make movie it was boring dull and way too serious. 
2. Although the original voice actor who played Mufasa came back for this remake movie I was absolutely disappointed in his  performance. His  dialogue were similar to the animated version but in no way was said with the same enthusiasm and seriousness, it was just boring and very dull. 
3. I enjoyed Nothing about this movie all I could do was shake my head during it all

3395,977945331,Will M,"I truly enjoyed the original Lion King, it deserves all the attention it gets. I was cautious as I entered the theater to see the latest Disney live action remake, although nothing in the film is not entirely computer generated. But I was hopeful, I wanted to enjoy this movie. Directed by Jon Favreau? I love Iron Man, and even the live-action Jungle Book! I will start with the pros. First and foremost, the VFX. This is probably the most photorealistic CGI I have ever seen in any movie ever, and I say that with confidence. I cannot imagine how long it took to animate this film. The casting was pretty good. I thought it was a smart move to hire James Earl Jones to voice Mufasa a second time, because, let us be honest, that guy is irreplaceable! Donald Glover as Simba, Beyonc√© as Nala, John Oliver as Zazu, were really good. I think the best voice performance, though, was Seth Rogen as Pumba. Now for the cons. Being a shot for shot remake, you know exactly what is going to happen, when it is going to happen, how it is going to happen, and so forth. The remake of Beauty And The Beast, which I also disliked, was shot for shot as well, but they sprinkled it with a few new songs, new scenes, and some dialogue alterations. The Lion King, on the other hand, the original has more scenes than this. They have shortened this movie by at least twenty minutes. Remember Be Prepared in the original? In this, the song is less than thirty seconds. Also, some of the characters do not have a fraction of the charm as they did in the original. For example, Rafiki is wise, but a bit of a joker in the original. In this, he is just wise. Even Scar is not as intimidating as he was. Another thing, being as photorealistic as it is, the characters cannot make facial expressions. Since the original was a cartoon, they could smile, frown, cry, scream, and gasp. Realistically speaking, a Lion cannot do any of those things. So when they talk, they look like they are simply opening their mouths, and this flaw is sometimes laughable. The biggest flaw, however, is that this movie has absolutely no reason to exist. There is not one thing wrong with the original, so why remake this if there is nothing that can be improved upon?

In short, this was the first movie I have ever seen in an acttheater that bored me to the point to where I longed for the credits to roll.",2019-08-01T15:23:04.950Z,0.0

3408,80531fab-cd3a-4e39-9460-def40c03fe03,Sean C,"The ""Live-Action"" (photo-realistic) remake of Disney's classic, The Lion King, was unnecessary. It was visually stunning, but fails to capture the raw emotion and heart of the original animated version. There were a couple of issues I had with the live-action remake. First, 3/4's of the film sounded like the actors phoned in their lines.  An exception to this is the musical number, ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight,"" which sounds like Beyonce Knowles and Donald Glover were actually in the studio. Second, there were a surprising amount of lines, musical numbers, and jokes that were cut from the live-action remake that was in the original animated film. The previous, coupled with the lack of facial expressions from the photo-realistic animals, made the film feel hollow and dull. Lastly, I was unimpressed by the amount of energy, life, and charisma the acting cast put into the characters. Especially Chiwetel Ejiofor who played a very flat Scar (I missed the sassy, sarcastic drama-king version that Jeremy Irons portrayed). The exceptions to this are James Earl Jones (Mufasa), Billy Eichner (Timon), and Seth Rogen (Pumbaa). The skit where Timon starts singing ""Be Our Guest"" from Disney's, Beauty and The Beast, was terrific and hilarious.",2019-08-01T14:48:03.320Z,0.0

3461,822101374,Johann M,"One of the most beloved tales produced by Walt Disney  Animation Studios comes to life in this ""live-action"" adaptation. Once again, as tragedy strikes the Kingdom of the Pride Lands, the young lion prince flees only to learn the true meaning of responsibility and bravery to take back what is rightfully his. However, despite the outstanding visual effects achievement that makes it such an out-of-this-world experience, it falls flat when it comes to conveying the same feelings and spirit of the original animated movie, perhaps due to the compulsory expressionless characters. A refreshing look, nonetheless, in many aspects and a wonderful voice cast that complements the overall experience.",2019-08-01T11:12:35.193Z,1.0

3514,978181010,Vivienne S,"Boring, uninspirational, and a study in mediocrity. The Lion King was so busy doing what they could that they didn't stop to wonder if they should. This movie is almost monochromatic, except instead of white and black, it's dull brown and green. I almost dozed off multiple times. The animals and scenery look incredibly real, but it meshes oddly with the voice actors. Which is it, Disney? You can't have realistic-looking scenes and talking animals. Oh, wait, but you did anyway-and the end result suffers. The movie is stuck, caught between hyper-realism and obvious, flat voice acting. The stripping of one of the film's best songs (Be Prepared) and complex characters (Scar) is also a cinematic crime. Scar used to be sarcastic and oddly charming as a villain, but after this shaved down version, he's a flat caricature that needs a bath and better conditioner. If photo-realism is the hill Disney wants to die on, I'm certainly not going to watch the Lady and the Tramp remake. Why should I pay to watch another terrible live-action that is forced to rely on nostalgia rather than stand up on its own two feet? At least Beauty and the Beast was pretty to look at, even if it changed little. Perhaps the best was the first: Cinderella was exquisite and charming, truly worthy of a live-action. If only Disney had put in half the effort here that was shown in the first of the remakes.",2019-08-01T05:23:47.018Z,0.0

3542,978107276,Andrew  H,"Amazing animation, however the ultra-realism didn't match the humour or wit of the 1994 animated version: this update matched the original literally scene for scene but didn't gel -- it was almost a David Attenborough documentary but with the addition of Sir David, having made one too many documentaries, losing the plot and creating the animals' voices.

Additionally, I can't see why they got (a very old-sounding) James Earl Jones back to voice Mufasa, but not the original voice actors for Scar, the hyenas, or Zazu: their remake counterparts simply further lost the appeal of what could've been a worthy addition to Disney's CGI lin-up (though Pete's Dragon was equally as unworthy of it's ""update) -- Maleficent, Dumbo, Jungle Book, Aladdin, BATB, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, 101 Dalmatians are brilliant (IMO).",2019-08-01T04:17:56.926Z,0.0

3600,978180789,Jack C,"Utter shame to watch. The preceding live-action transformations of Disney films, such as Aladdin, have been bearable, perhaps to a degree exciting. This movie, however, was plain sponge cake, lacking the exuberance of the original, (despite being glittered on the top with A List stars). Beyonc√©'s singing, for instance, is faultless - even with great studio refinement. But having a very out-of-place song of hers upon the determined return of Simba is just cringeworthy.


Nevertheless, for new generations of children, Disney has to adapt its productions to popular trends in order to profit. But count me out. As menacing as Scar was, Disney have faltered in reproducing a story - which, was not even their first original in 1994 (see Kimba/Simba controversy) - and consequently we have to endure all this hype about something extremely underwhelming.",2019-08-01T01:41:08.638Z,0.0

All that effort should be put in making new great animation features instead of live remakes. And I'm not only talking about 3d animation, we see less and less 2d animation and I think it's a shame.",2019-07-31T23:17:31.204Z,0.0

3692,789329583,Naama B,"This was such a disappointment. I think if you are remaking a movie, you need to improve upon or be very loyal to the original. This did neither: from very bad timing in interactions between characters, very inexpressive characters, and poor script, a huge part of the lion king's glory is in its witty jokes and heart felt connections between the characters. It was difficult to relate to Simba or Nala, Timon and Pumba we're ok, but the originals were still better. Seth Rogan was probably the only good thing about this movie. Scar was really poorly portrayed, and far less terrifying than Alan Rickley's scar. All in all, very disappointing. ",2019-07-31T20:52:53.397Z,0.0

The animals looked absolutely fantastic - if this were a nature show. But, as far as emoting and engaging the audience in the story, it just fails completely. I think it's just a limitation of transitioning from an animated medium to a live action one where anthropomorphizing the animals to express emotions would probably just look weird.

Many of the voice actors I also felt were flat. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Donald Glover, & Beyonc√©'s performances were just lifeless. Not to mention I could barely hear/make out the majority of John Oliver's dialogue. James Earl Jones was perfect and spot on as usual. The songs were good, not as good as the original imo, but still they weren't too bad. I missed the original ""Be Prepared"" and that Beyonc√© song seemed so out of place. I would have liked to of had ""He Lives In You"" by Lebo M. actually in the movie instead of relegated to the credits, it's a great song.",2019-07-31T15:19:47.787Z,0.0

None of the changes made anything better, especially for the music, they tried to hard to make it better and unfortunately you can tell. 
If Disney wants to regurgitate old ideas I would personally appreciate at LEAST replacing original music or script with something better, not worse.

3786,976695291,Tom H,"The prefect remake! Sure, there were things that I wanted that were in the original but not in this one, but I have to remind myself that they're separate films. 
It has an amazingly strong cast, it's funny, beautiful to look at and there's a great beauty and the beast reference. 
Billy Eichner asTimon is without a doubt the best character in the film, he brings a new side to Timon that probably wouldn't have worked in 94 but is perfect for the character!
(Beyonce's casting made me sceptical at first but she's actually really good as Nala).
The crititcs won't enjoy this film because it doesn't really offer anything new other than the visuals, but that's literally exactly what the audience wants, if you love the original, you'll love this.
There's a few points in the film that lacks a little bit of emotion which is why I'm not giving it 5 stars BUT we have to realise that this is what we asked for and it's just something that goes with that, it helps to keep it grounded and 'real'.

This version of the Lion King is visually stunning and excellently paced. There are many fun new changes to the film that keep it fresh. While Beyonc√© was underused, John Oliver soars as Zazu and Gambino plays a great Simba. The emotional moments still hit just as hard as they used to while much of the music is scaled back in favor of intense almost Star Wars like action scenes. Director Jon Favreau takes The Lion King and transforms it into modern animation and thrilling suspense. If you want to hear all the songs again, listen to the soundtrack or go see the show on Broadway.

3827,978179895,Kayla T,"I ABSOLUTELY hated this movie. Growing up on lion king, them singing, dancing and the emotional journey the movie took us on. I understand you can only do so much with ""live action"". But before someone does a ""live action"" movie with animals I think they should study the animal and how they act. Example: simba roars and the  wildebeest come running down the cliff. The live action had simba standing there saying ""oh no."" An actual cat would have probably layers it's ears down and hunkered down in fear. Kind of what they did in the cartoon. And I'm actually pissed about scar. Scar was shown to be mean, scary and very dark. His voice was very dark and unsettling. Example: in the cartoon mufasa jumps on the cliff, climbs to the top to see scar staring down at him. Mufasa then asks scar to help him and scar proceeds to dig his claws into mufasas arms and in a scary deep clam voice tells mufasa ""long....live...... the king"". In the live action mufasa climbs up to the top of the cliff to find scar. In this scene scar digs his claws into mufasa (just like the original) the in a very high toned voice and yells ""long live the king"". There was no emotion given in this scene and this was THE MOST EMOTIONAL SCENE OF THE MOVIE. This movie was NOT the movie to choose to do a live action. Many things where left out. The emotional was not given, there was no accuracy in this movie in which lions ""actually move"" since they where going for live action. Everything was dull. The symbolism was left out with  Rafiki  And simba. Example:  Rafiki  Hits simba in the head with the stick. Simba asks ""what was that for""  and Rafiki replies ""doesn't matter it was in the past"". There was SO much that they could have done with this film. It was SUCH a disappointment. I will NEVER buy this movie. EVER. The original was so much better. ",2019-07-31T10:15:59.504Z,0.0

I mean it even had popular pop icons and no new top over the line make me wanna cry bring out the inner queen songs or nothing. ,2019-07-31T06:58:41.068Z,1.0

They changed some of the most iconic lines, and removed one of the most valuable lessons in the story about learning from the past and just left us with the revelation that Simba is still Mufasa's son, but delivered in a less impactful way. I think they focused so much on making it look real that they forgot to make it FEEL real. A compromise between realism and animation should have been made, they could have used the actors actual expressions and overlaid them onto the CGI like they did for Avatar, but noooo.

3880,928218731,Michael L,"One of the biggest complaints movie critics had for this film was the fact that played out like the animated movie from 1994. They are right, it does play out very similar to the 1994 film. That is why it's called a ""remake"". It wouldn't be a remake if they wrote a brand new story. Critics are overpaid.

I took my two oldest daughters to this today, and we all loved it. The familiar music, the familiar lines and scenes all brought back memories to the classic original, which remains to this day my favorite Disney film. The added humor, and even some hilarious line changes and references to other Disney movies make this adaptation unique enough to not be an exact clone of the original, but with the same characters, plot and story that we've all come to love.

There is some elements of scare for smaller children as the CGI does make the animals look real, but the humor, fun and playful nature of characters like Timon and Pumba largely make up for the occasional scare.

And yes, I LOVED the new version of ""Be Prepared"", because the animated version had hundreds of Hyenas lined up like a Nazi Germany parade, and this film was much more lifelike in its portrayal of the hyenas.

Don't listen to the naysayers and just go see the film and judge it for yourself.  ",2019-07-31T04:41:04.698Z,1.0

3935,978179547,Eliza B,"One of my most favorite movies that is instant classic in our home. So much that it was top of my list to see Disney live show when at WDW and see kiddo perform in kid show locally.  After months of soundtrack still never tire of music or story.  Was pumped to see this tonight.... but deeply underwhelming. 

Had such high hopes but did not like darker style of story or that some scenes adjusted because it changed the story too much.  Thank goodness for James Earl Jones who is the only Mufasa!  Some decent or mediocre performances and some downright awful.  Almost left theatre, but felt committed to see it through.  My 11 year old who also LOVES lion king asked 3x to go home. 

 I have never given a review, but honestly save your $ and wait to see on tv.  We saw in 3D so cgi great, but not enough to bump up score.  This was completely unnecessary to redo and I am so over all the Disney remakes.  Ready for original material.  ",2019-07-31T03:02:03.681Z,0.0
3936,978179552,Bianca R,"-First few minutes of the intro gave me shills, it was great. A sense of community was present at first that slowly dissipated. The story became more self-centered as it went on.  
-Gorgeous character and landscape visuals except the stars 
-Great recorded animal behaviors 
-Quick, bland and inadequate script writing (with a few good jokes once in a while) 
-Young Simba is a small miscast(The character itself is not courageous, not fooled, but foolish from the get go) the high-pitch voice wasn't very soothing)
-Cut shorter than the previous version 
-Lack of depth
-Wisdom filled messages covered up by hurried script writing once again 
-Failure to represent the ""normal distribution"" that shapes a society. Of course it's always good vs evil with Disney. Truth is, it is getting old and real life is much more nuanced. The encouragement of said stereotypes aren't very educational, especially when there are no facts or reasons built around to explain a wrongdoer's actions, leaving the impression that it is okay to forget to have empathy and feel self-righteous. Sure Scar can be petty, lie and cruel in his intentions. Shouldn't the hero ask himself a bit more questions as to why? Children aren't born that way, that's for sure... 
-The villain or opponent is showed as less intelligent and sly. He doesn't truly need to manipulate Simba all that much since the cub just follows him along. Didn't he have a warning from Moufassa or has the King too much on his mind to warn the son he so dearly cares for? Doesn't make sense. 
-Some people will start to question the difference between courage, risk and poor judgement. 
-Tasteful soundtrack 
---This is an on-the-side comment---
It would be extraordinary if Disney stopped making super-hero movies all while re-creating or (re-stashing) their traditional masterpieces, even if they generate big bucks. They are a multi-billion dollar company and are looking like they run on greed more than dreams now a days. It would be extraordinary if they worked towards more original content. Now is not the time for distractions, but to make people more self and world-aware. Even a message promoting a good charity at the end would have been an interesting to do.

So I will give Disney credit for sticking to the original story line.  A few things were different, but not in a bad way.  My problem with the movie was mostly with the dialog and singing.  First, Beyonce should never have been cast for this.  Her signing is good (usually), but her voice overs and her song in the movie were just flat terrible!  Then there was hakuna matata......it was just so flat and boring.  The original is so fun and engaging.  This version was none of that.  And then there was the rest of the dialog of the actors.  It was like listening to a B movie with rookie actors.  They knew the lines, but no emotions, no flow and just bad.

Although it seems like it took its longer runtime and placed those extra minutes on all the wrong things (I'm looking at you, mouse & Simba's hair floating). Overall, the movie is an alright reimagining (if you can even call it that) of the original film, although I wouldn't necessarily recommend it.

3989,855810299,Norman P,"The Lion King (2019)

A little late with this review, but watched it in the cinemas about a week ago.

Lion King has always be my all time favourite Disney cartoon, despite whatever people may say about it regarding the lack of originality of it all. So when news of the remake came out, I was doubtful of the quality of it, as most remakes usually fall flat on its face.

And this was no different. Apart from the amazingly life-like CGI and the sporadic nostalgia-evoking moments, the whole remake fell way short of the original animation. Voice actors were not picked properly, feeling like they were cast merely for their name.

Rafiki's role felt sidelined, without much emphasis on his impact on Simba's decisions and change of heart. Despite having a heavyweight cast of musicians, the songs felt flat and uninspired, emotionless. ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" was butchered, and sung in broad daylight.

Overall, it was disappointing, but not the worst Disney remake.

For those who have seen the animated feature when it came out in the 90's, this will be a luke-warm, yet courageous attempt to recreate the magical original with fantastic CG imagery. Personally, I thought the casting of Beyonce as the voice of Nala was a major flaw. I didn't know who's voice it was - just that it was jarringly not in sync with the rest of the cast.

While it is obvious that a lot of money and effort was put into the photo-realistic animation, the lack of expressiveness really hurts it in places. The audience at my theater straight up laughed at the scene when Simba yelled ""no!"" with a totally blank expression as Mufasa was plunging to his death. When the movie flashes back to that scene near the end, they laughed AGAIN. One of the most notoriously crushing scenes in movie history, completely robbed of its impact by a production that was so committed to realism that they refused to match the emotion of the voice acting with the facial expressions of its characters.

4081,978179047,Curt H,"Amazing CGI...just amazing. I was so excited to see this movie. I still remember singing the original songs for weeks after seeing the first movie. The cartoon version seemed to draw me in more.  They cartoon was expressive and I was connected emotionally to the cartoon characters. I found that lacking in the CGI version and was sometime confused which lioness I was looking at. I just didn't connect with the characters. The story seemed much darker and violent than I remember. I would definitely not recommend taking a child to see this movie. 
One definite highlight is Seth Rogan as the wart hog. Its funny, it was just Seth being Seth, but even his natural laugh fit the character.
Id still recommend the movie, if I had never see the original this would be a totally positive review. ",2019-07-30T19:40:39.806Z,1.0

4117,972659636,Livi H,"After seeing the movie Sunday, and chewing over the details, here's my hot-take. Its not the medium of photo-realistic CGI, or the downsizing of the songs that made the film mediocre for me. Its the delivery of the lines. I know for a fact that in the original movie I flipping bawl at Mufasa's death scene every time I watch it. In the new version I understood that I should be sad, but damn was the emotion cold! There was so little emotion in the most emotional scene. That sentiment was consistent throughout the movie in most of the dramatic scenes, and heck some of the more comedic scenes too. I'm not angry, ""just disappointed"". Its a passable copy, and i will admit that seeing some of the scenes in that beautiful CGI moved me in a new nostalgic way,( the opening sequence, the storm on pride rock) but that's it, its just a beautiful copy with some serious delivery problems. Also, what the hell is up with that Beauty and the Beast reference? That was a wasted comedic opportunity to do something new and clever. Last thing, the Spirit song...way to cheat me out of that chest thumping ""Return to Pride Rock"" sequence. The new song could have gone into the credits...",2019-07-30T17:29:02.555Z,0.0

The actors were not dramatic enough and some cannot act at all. Some of the new songs didn't fit the movie plot and the old songs were underwhelming. I appreciated how they extended the story a bit but some scenes didn't add substance, only length. And there were some overly-dramatic, iconic scenes from the original that they completely took out that made the original stand out.

In summary, I think the the writers, directors and actors didn't do the original justice. There was only a 25-year gap between the original and this rendition...meaning most people who saw the original would have taken their kids to see this new one, so they should have done focus groups or something for their decisions.",2019-07-30T16:54:53.687Z,0.0

Nobody can say that the visuals aren't good but at the end of the day is about the story and it feels to me that lacks of soul, fast, with the only purposse on trying to delivery the exact same bits as the original but fails. 

Jon Favreau sacrifice realism over emotion and effective timing.

This was a pointless attempt on recreating a masterpice. I hate grading films but if I have to put a number I'll say... 4/10. 

It's a movie... I'll not want to see it again. And because of that makes it a failure.",2019-07-30T16:06:01.324Z,0.0

4161,ab22c953-1d13-4b91-9ce6-4fd046c81a81,Robert M,"Comparing against the live action stage musical and original anime, I gave the Disney 2019 ""The Lion King"" a four of five stars. IF the ""live"" action musical movie had come out first, ahead of the live action stage option, I would have given it a five. It took a while to figure out where the new musical score and other new items were spread out through this version.  I think what really impressed me was also what degraded the movie to a four (instead of a five) was the fact that animals do not ""operate"" or ""work"" together like portrayed in the movie (real world, I know what a drag), so my brain was functioning more as an analyst trying to see where the real animals were in comparison to the CGI pieces.

If you have never seen the original anime or stage musical, then this movie would be a five and blow out the competition for the 2020 Oscars (Feb 2020). But I think what will likely happen is this version of the Lion King will get best/most technical of productions (I mean the CGI blending was that good), but it will not get best picture nomination more likely best screen adaptation, but it will be a STEEP competition against Cats (live action musical movie version) coming out for that title.",2019-07-30T15:48:49.785Z,1.0

This brilliant CGI version of LK is a technical triumph. Never before has this new form of film making look so convincing. It is eye-popping - the animals, the environments, the whole of nature. The lack of people is a huge bonus.

Despite this, some contend there is no reason to remake the now 25 year old cartoon in this way, and maybe they have a point. The cartoon is excellent, vibrant and original. This version is very good but adds little to the original and when it is flat dramatically, this becomes an issue.

On the other hand, the script is sharp, the songs enjoyable (not superb), the performances are top class (who know John Oliver would make such a great bird?). Ejiofor's Scar is superb, as is Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner. The leads - JE Jones, Donald Glover and Beyonce also acquit themselves well.

I recommend ignoring the critics and going out to see Lion King as soon as possible! A TRUE Lion King fan will truly appreciate this movie. While it is virtually identical to the animated movie, seeing the plot unfold with real animals invoked a feeling of nostalgia along with a childlike sense of wonder. The movie had me crying and laughing, and I walked out with a smile on my face. This was an amazing tribute to one of the greatest films ever created.

4339,260059055,,It just didn‚Äôt work for me. They changed dialogue that didn‚Äôt need to be changed and added extra detail in strange places (like Simba‚Äôs hair tuft coming back to Rafiki).

4340,978071343,Braidin P,"Jon Favreau's ""The Lion King"" is underwhelming. First off, I really liked ""Reflections of Mufasa"" is the best music track in the movie. It felt just as powerful as it did in 1994. It's also visually stunning.  Besides that, it lacked what the original offered. Scar was more aggressive than satirical in this film. He felt very different than how he was in 1994. The biggest complaint is that lack of emotion that was shown in the Lions faces. For example, after Mufasa is trampled, McCrary does a decent job expressing the sadness in Simba's voice, but the Lion has a blank expression on his face. It takes away the power of the scene if Simba doesn't look upset about his fathers death. It's clear it's not possible to put such expressions on a ""life-like"" lion which is why the movie shouldn't have been made in the first place. Pumbaa and Timon kept their original personalities which was very reassuring. To sum this movie up in one sentence ""A beautiful movie isn't necessarily a good movie"" (3/5)",2019-07-30T05:18:22.152Z,0.0

It concentrated on the battles which took up more than half of the movie. The characters of Nala and others were left as undeveloped and unnecessary to the story as a whole. I could never take my granddaughters to see this movie for fear they would be so traumatized by the violence.  I almost left the movie half way thru because I was so disgusted by it.

Beyonc fell a little flat as Nala, but Donald Glover pretty much nailed it as Simba. A bit disappointed with the songs overall, but not enough to detract from the film. As for the theater, we had the misfortune of sitting near a woman who insisted on loudly whispering to her child during the entire film claiming she had to do so and that it was a children's film. We only asked that she lower the volume, yet somehow she felt she had the right to impose her self righteous inconsideration on others. She went out to get a manager - wondered if she shouted at him that there was someone in the theater who dared wanting her to be quiet during the movie!

Cons: Voice acting for some of the main characters was a major disappointment (Hyenas, Nala, and Scar). One of the most memorable songs in the original movie got butchered on the remake (Be prepared). Most of the one-liners from the original film were missing and did not get replaced with something similar or better. 

Passing grade: Voice acting on the rest of the characters, Rafiki was good but could have been better.

Overall it was a decent movie to watch, but it is better to wait until it comes out on DVD. Not worth the money one pays to see it in the theater, with that said save your money as it is not worth a trip to the theater.",2019-07-29T21:36:56.270Z,0.0
4580,978177764,Annalise A,"Any live action Disney remake has big shoes to fill, and the Lion King is one of the biggest, and unfortunately the 2019 remake is the least entertaining of all the Disney remakes. The decision to stick to realism robs the characters of the ability to emote and makes the voice acting feel ineffective and uncomfortable. The 2019 version is somehow a half an hour longer than the original and that is mostly due to ineffective storytelling. Finally, the biggest gripe that I have with this movie is that it reveals nothing more of the story that we've all seen and loved, it is almost a shot for shot remake of the original but with (truly breath taking and amazing) CGI. Not worth seeing, just watch the original for free on HBO. ",2019-07-29T21:30:59.988Z,0.0
4581,932299140,Rick K,"It was a great movie. Yes, a remake, BUT a much better movie than the original. You'll notice, majority of critics trashing the movie are solely doing so for the technology. I've seen a review that said the critic ""didn't feel connected"" due to the life-like realism of the animals. I find that very hard to believe unless the critic went into the movie not liking the idea that it's a remake from the start. If that were true, than the critic had a strong bias already. Another review somehow came to the conclusion that the technology controlled the movie. No, again: the animals and life-like appearance was realized by the audience from the start of the movie (assuming nobody in the audience saw any trailers beforehand). It was a very good balance of the technology combined with the voice acting that matched the animals brilliantly. I'd say 99% of the other children's movie reviews by those same critics would have some Debbie downer review to them as well. It's irritating to have to filter through reviews based on the validity of the reviews themselves. Hopefully, people check the audience reviews over the critics on this movie for that very reason.

4588,978141881,Pernille L,"This movie was definitely beautiful to watch and I did enjoy watching it, but if I'm being honest, I exited the movie theater with a 'meh' feeling afterwards. The thing that drives this is the nostalgia, because without it, I don't think the movie would have done so well. 

I felt like it was missing someting. It did provide us with something new, as in new jokes, scenes and a new song, but it didn't evoke the same emotional response i get, when I watch the original. The animated animals, being as lifelike as they were, don't really articulate emotion very well (at least in my opinion). The infamous death of Mufasa fell kinda flat to me and this is a scene that always brings me to tears. There is a certain disconnect, when you can hear the sadness in Simbas voice, but the animation cannot show the despair in his face, which the original did very well. 

Another thing, and this is probably just me, is that I couldn't differentiate between the different lionesses. If they didn't speak, Sarabi and Nala looked identical to me (but this is just nitpicking).

I would have loved for this beautiful CGI, the great actors and the creativity to be used to tell a new story, instead of making a frame by frame repeat of what we've already seen. ",2019-07-29T20:48:18.979Z,0.0

It was nice that James Earl Jones reprises his role as Mufasa. However, I cannot understand why Jeremy Irons was not called upon to play Scar once again as most of the familiarity of the film stems from those characters.

Like 'The Jungle Book' and 'Aladdin', I was curious as to 1) how a live adaptation would look and 2) what changes would be made to make the story more interesting. On the first note, the film looked amazing. Seeing everything in live action made the viewing worthwhile. However, do not go into this movie expecting anything but a shot-for-shot remake. In fact, the minor changes that were made from the original, are to the detriment of the overall story. Some of my favorite shots from the animated version were missing, whereas others (pretty much the entire opening 'Circle of Life' scene) were exactly as you remember from the 1994 version. Bottom line, the animated version was much better and there was no need for this film if they were going to stick so close to the original. It was like seeing your favorite black and white comic redone by different artists in a color version that was not as good as the original. I walked away from this film thinking ""why""? I will say, John Oliver, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen were the stand out stars. They (along with the faux cinematography) made the movie worth seeing.",2019-07-29T19:48:28.872Z,0.0

However, casting John Oliver as Zazu's voice really felt off.  He doesn't come off as a good voice actor, most cringe worthly lines at the start of the movie which set the tone for the rest.

I was disappointed with Timon and Pumbaa, Zazu, Scar, and especially Nala. I'm sorry to say but Beyonce butcher Nala there was no chemistry It sounded like she was just reading her lines But when it came to her music she tried to outsing and seemed to effort into that. She needed to put more effort into her character. Timon and Pumbaa didn't really seem to have much chemistry there were parts that were funny but the singing wasn't that great. for scar some of his parts were really good and he was getting into it and other parts it didn't seem to be scar and be prepared song was butchered.and I wasn't very impressed with the little Simba he seem to be a little too cocky.

Timon & Pumbaa are stand outs in the film hilarious. King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi were awesome I loved every time they were on scene. Beyonc was also very good & she added something extra to adult Nala character. The movie is beautiful and the visuals are gorgeous.

4724,d65571c1-3e6b-41d9-8324-e9eb56476ada,Christina P,"First of all, the movie is absolutely beautiful. The scenery is gorgeous with sweeping views of the landscape that will take your breath away. The animals are rendered beautifully as well. The hair blowing in the breeze and the way they move is just spectacularly done. I also liked the re-interpretation and updates they did to some of the soundtrack music. I really enjoyed the cello and pipe solos in particular.

However, as a movie, I was quite disappointed and even... bored. And I love the Lion King and the story line. Some of the voice actors seemed apathetic reading the lines, even James Earl Jones. I realize it can't be easy to redo lines, but he sounded like he had gotten stopped at a con and asked to say the lines for the 20th time that day. The kid actors' lines were cringy, and Timon and Pumba sounded like they were trying to rile up an unresponsive crowd. The animators made pretty much no effort to show emotion on the animal's faces. Simba looked the same when his dad died as when he was singing I Just Can't Wait to be King. I understand they were going for realistic and not cartoony, but my dog shows more emotion on a daily basis with ears and eyebrows and body language. It doesn't have to be human-ized to be emotional. The songs that we grew to love were shortened or talked through instead of sung. Be Prepared was the worst example of this. Also, with the award-winning Broadway show music right there why invent a new song for Simba to cross the desert to?

All together, this made for a movie that I was tempted to check my email and FB feed during. It just didn't capture and hold me like most movies do. My ten year old actually asked me ""How much longer?"" during Hakuna Matata. I've told my friends just to wait until it comes out on Netflix or whatever and don't waste your time seeing it in theaters.",2019-07-29T14:57:39.282Z,0.0

But i do have to say that this movie has no emotion to it, every scene if they were sad or angry just seemed to be the same. You could tell everyone was reading from a script and they need to not have singers in these movies anymore. It just isn't good. To sum it up short no emotion, everything sounds scripted, animals looked amazing but it wasn't enough to be able to say it's better than the classic.",2019-07-29T14:56:17.000Z,1.0

This rendition is the reverse of it: Over-hyped and udner preformed. No emotion and lack of acting, the funniest and most memorable moments completely washed out or missing, and the best song ""Be Prepared"" is only 30 secs long.

The lack of discernable emotion from any of the characters paired with genuinely good voice acting comes off as uncanny. 'Be Prepared' one of our favorite Disney villain songs is replaced by something of a strange spoken word yet syncopated soliloquy. My wife also noticed two percieved ""woke"" moments that I was oblivious to. If you can explain that violence against bullies is wrong, and that a male lion could handle a clan of hyenas on his own your kids should be fine.

4737,a97da92d-7e18-443f-a145-a25c69035f7f,Ravi Nolan,"This reboot had its pros and cons

Pros: The CGI makes it feel like you are watching the discovery channel or animal planet at times. The scenery and the fluid motion of the characters is jaw dropping throughout most of the movie. The acting staff did a fantastic job and managed to keep the film right in line with its past, but each gave it thier own unique spin. 

Cons: Its really weired and slightly uncomfortable watching these realistic animals talking. Unlike the animated version, characters can be very hard to tell apart from each other, especially in the fight scenes. Some of the interpretations of the songs had to much done to them. The biggest con for me was Rafiki as he is one of my all time Disney favorites. They seemed to take away his playfulness.

For those that don‚Äôt understand the difference: ‚ÄúRemake means that a film is made after a previous film and is almost a copy of the previous film. Themes, thematic elements, and characters will be the same and have the same motivations. ... A reboot will often have different stylisic elements and will attempt to distance itself from the previous film.‚Äù  Jon Favreau and his team purposefully removed key parts (lines) of the movie that made the original so memorable. I also agree with the majority of the reviews I have read about casting big stars for the roles that do not require star power. And lastly - I really did try to enjoy the film but, Beyonce‚Äô voice over of Nala stuck out like a sore thumb. While there is nothing wrong with a southern drawl (I have one), as a trained actor/actress, you must be aware of your tone and how you pronounce certain words like ‚Äúyou‚Äù.

4908,789641593,Richard S,"I thought I was emotionally stable enough to cope with The Lion King.  It turns out I was wrong. I won't cover the story here because surely there is no one currently on planet Earth who does not know the story of The Lion King? However, I will say it's pretty much a scene by scene copy, with a few extra fillers to stretch the film out to it's 2 hour running time.  The screenplay has had some alterations but a lot of the classic and most memorable scenes are scripted the same with a few amusing nods to the original where the script has been updated slightly. 
Visually the film looks amazing and it is the realism that perhaps makes a couple of the scenes (hyenas in the elephant graveyard) a little scarier and perhaps not suitable for the really small people, and THAT scene in the gorge with the stampede is made a whole lot more emotionally gut wrenching. 
The voice cast are all pretty good, the hyenas weren't as funny as the original and the ""ooh Mufasa, say it again"" line is missing which is pretty tragic but it's only a small quibble. Seth Rogan and Billy Eichner were perfect choice for Pumba and Timon but the big one, the main attraction of this piece is Scar.  No one was going to be able to live up to Jeremy Iron's brilliant mix of camp and cruelty and in Chiwetel Ejiofor's favour, he doesn't attempt to replicate that performance.  He puts his own spin on the character, Scar in this version is somewhat darker but still just as enjoyable, he is one of the greatest villains in cinema history and Chiwetel does a more than decent job of voicing the iconic baddie on the big screen.

4909,978176985,Samuel F,"Quick version: The story had nothing new to say, the graphics were good, Timone and Pumba were still funny, they ruined Raffiky.
Long version: Timone and Pumba were okay, they seemed to change the jokes enough to be fresh but without changing their dynamic. Raffiky (appologies if misspelled) was a ruined for me as they removed most of his lines including the great life advice and his sense of humour about life and accepting the past. Why did they made this change? I assume some people found his humour a bit dark or lacking empathy for a kid's movie, and I guess it was a bit violent.
The rest of the movie story was almost the same with only minor changes in dialog. The previously implied relationship that scar had with the hyenas was not there making the turn against him at the end a bit more believable but made the alliance with him early in the movie less believable.
One thing that was done pretty well was the animal behaviours seemed more realistic, which makes sense considering disney's nature documentary projects and of course the graphics were pretty impresive.",2019-07-29T09:08:47.160Z,0.0

4917,978176978,Elmar G,"""Comparison is the thief of joy."" - Theodore Roosevelt

First of all, I am probably the biggest Lion King fan on this planet (self-proclaimed). I'm your typical '93 kid. Seeing my childhood memories coming to life and being recreated in a new and creative manner is something that I could never have dreamed of. When it comes to the Lion King, this was the live remake I was the most excited for.

My unpopular opinion: it was SUCH a great film. I went into the movie not expecting it to be exactly the same as the animation, and wanted to watch it as a film by itself. I went to go see it with an open mind. I did not want to watch it, and compare it to the original. I think that's the key in watching these remakes.

Overall, most people seem to be critiquing (complaining about) the ""emotionless"" characteristics of the animals. Personally, it did not affect my viewing experience at all. One could still feel the emotion, and feel the mood of every scene. If the animals were portrayed any other way, it would have felt awkward and unnatural in the ""live world"" that the team created. Especially in the ""real life world"" - it would not have suit the narrative. If you wanted to see unnatural emotions and expressions, then rather go watch the animation again. The cinematography compensates for these ""lack of emotions"", and creates a beautiful atmosphere that pulls you right into the story.

For me, my only critique would be the character-design of Scar. I think that, visually, he wasn't up to scratch. The absence of his signature black hair and more prominent scar on the face made him fade a bit.

All in all, I was absolutely mind-blown, and I have already seen it twice. People were tearing up during the Mufasa scene. People were SINGING the songs they heard when they grew up.

4925,978176922,Ahmed M,"There was a lot of work put into making the animals as ""realistic"" as possible. If you want to see pretty animals go through the motions of the Disney classic, then this film is for you. The effects look amazing. But the ""realism"" works to it detriment. The emotion and heart in an animated move cannot be re-enacted with extremely photo realistic animals. The animals cant express facial emotion. Animals express emotion differently. I've never felt more cold during Mufasa's death because all the character's eyes are so dead. I'm sure the actors really tried, but when the voice comes out of expressionless faces, its for nothing. But even THATS tough because so many lines sound like the first take. 

It felt like they deflated the big moments and focused too much on the little moments. The stampede never had the feeling of urgency like it did during animation. Rafiki never gives the lesson about learning from your past. But what do they focus on? The entire journey of Simba's hair to Rafiki, down to when its eaten by a giraffe, then cuts to the giraffes poop being rolled by a dung beetle. Why. All you had to do was carry his hair by the wind. Thats it.

The cherries on top that really disappointed me? The Hyena's werent funny. They turned ""Be Prepared,"" the one song I liked from the original, into a lazy spoken word poetry slam with a note that sounded liked Chiwetel Ejiofor had a couple of shots before the song (not the actors fault, this definitely sounds like a voice directing issue with the tone of the song). No Steam, no lights, no sense of rising power... just an old lion pacing back and forth on rocks. Beyonce's voice was distracting as hell, and I guess they spent the last of the budget getting Beyonce in the first place because they couldnt afford to show Mufasa in the clouds. Yeah. He's not there.ha

What was good? Timon and Pumba. They actually were different enough to still be funny.",2019-07-29T08:00:15.724Z,0.0

4997,978170070,Austin S,"Most of the movie was great including the voice actor of Nala, Simba, and of course Mufasa. The only thing I didn't like was how they changed the ""be prepared"" song and how they used a song from Beauty and the Beast. Beyonc√© and Danny Glover have great chemistry. This remake may not be all like the original, i'd Still buy it on dvd and Blu-ray. Plus they made the environment look real as possible even though the animals were CGI.

5006,834761774,,"I also did see the new Lion King. This one is hard for me. The Lion King is my favorite Disney film of all time, probably top 5 in general if not too 3. I was very excited about this when it was announced but also worried. I like what Jon Favreau did with it and when I heard he was doing LK I was very excited. The last week before the release I watched an interview and he said that this is not a remake and he doesn‚Äôt want people to think that, this is just a reimagining of a classic tale and this brightened my interest 10 fold. Now, it‚Äôs not perfect, it is not better than the original but it is still enjoyable. There were some things that were taken out that I wish were in it, but what I couldn‚Äôt get with was Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar. Chiwetel is one of my favorite actors and I‚Äôm not sure, it just didn‚Äôt mesh with me. He wasn‚Äôt as menacing as he should be, he didn‚Äôt seem as methodical, his look even wasn‚Äôt as menacing as I feel it should. I know they probably wanted it to be different, they got James Earl Jones, I wish they could‚Äôve gotten Jeremy Irons for Scar. But I still really enjoyed it, I sang with a bunch of 7 year olds around me, I cried at the parts you cry at, and I enjoyed it fully.",2019-07-29T04:18:41.513Z,1.0

I grew up on that movie,  so this is from a true lion king fan.  I thought the cgi animation was spot on and truly captured what I would imagine lion king being in real world.  I love the subtle changes with today world kept in mind.  I only disliked that the voice for Napa was Beyonc.  No offense to Beyonc as she is queen B.  But her voice just sticks out like a sore thumb and we dont think Nala but we think Beyonc.  No fault but the glamour of Beyonc that people love.

  Gotta say, this one was a winner in my book. It didn't leave me with a ""this is real"" feeling, but it let me commisurate with the lions and detest Scar and the hyenas. The little lion grew into a great one. The cycle will probably continue with another movie.",2019-07-29T03:28:21.662Z,1.0

The only pitfall that keeps this from being a 5/5 is Beyonce's performance. It was definitely a mistake casting her next to Donald Glover. Her performance was flat.

It was also difficult for him to stay attentive asked several times if it was over yet and he loves the movies and will sit and watch a movie without problem.. I will stay with the old version.,2019-07-29T03:20:19.202Z,0.0

5078,978174262,GFIREOFCOOL 9,"so the film takes the original,and sh*ts on it.

all of the lions are hard to tell apart,most of the characters are ugly,and all of the songs are boring to watch.Most of the characters just walk around singing.I like the original be prepared,but this movie somehow made it suck.they added a  new hyena and made her nala's rival.

the main problem I have is all of the lions have one facial expression.And they all look the same.the thing with animation is the lions faces show such emotion and the original captures this emotion perfectly.I found myself sad when i saw scar walk up to simba when mufasa died(in the original) ,and this(the remake) just doesn't get it.",2019-07-29T03:05:35.351Z,0.0

This film was wildly mediocre with respect to the voices, and if you're going to do a Nat Geo-style  remake, at least have some real animals and forgive out how to make that work. I'm glad they didn't go over-the-top political (with the exception of John Oliver and Zazu getting pounced), but I honestly would've given more stars if Jeremy Irons and Matthews Broderick came back in the film as-is.

But with the realism comes zero magic. Be Prepared was particularly terrible, but the rest of the song scenes also suffer from the lack of fun and color in the original. If I only saw this one, I would find it interesting, but having seen the source material and their overall lack of straying from the original script, it doesn't compare well.

5245,977993258,Matthew B,"Jon Favreau said with ""Lion King"" he sought to change the medium not the story. Much as Julie Taymor (who ironically serves as a producer on the film) did with her broadway show. That's what this film is, a change of medium. Favreau beautifully take the animation style he developed for the ""Jungle Book"" to tell the story of the ""Lion King."" The original ""Lion King"" was so timeless that no adaptation can top it and that's probably why he chose not to try. Critics who bash this film are missing the point, its suppose to be the same film.

5252,976723497,Kenneth W,"The original ""The Lion King""  was the first movie I took my 4-year old son to watch.  It also became a favorite in our family's video collection. So, this movie has a special place in my heart.

Interestingly, as my son grew older and entered his college years, new friends (Scars) came into his life and he was talked out of the strong values, and principles instilled in him. Even his life calling, for which he was blessed with amazing leadership abilities and creative talents to fulfill, was derailed. Finally, he forgot who he was.

But as the years have gone by, just as in the movie, he was reminded, ""Remember who you are."" and take responsibility for your life and calling. Look to your duty, care for your family, and become a positive force in your community to protect and keep it strong.

Through the years I, too, have felt the discouraging forces of the world try to talk me out of my calling and purpose. Often times, I felt the voice of the King from Heaven say, ""Remember who you are. Remember who you are.""

The Lion King story reminds us that life is not all, Hakuna Matata. We can run away from reality and try to ignore it, but at some point the inner complacency and outer spreading evil must be faced and dealt with.

Opposing forces still try to hold my son at bay, but, I am happy to report the young prince is remembering who he is and is rising up to be the man he was meant to be. One day, he will stand at the top of Pride Rock as a true and noble king.",2019-07-28T22:30:02.910Z,1.0

5277,794065432,,"The Lion King is an ambitious remake of the 1994 animated classic. It is part of a large series of live-action remakes Disney has been doing over the last ten years. (Other live-action remakes from Disney include Cinderella, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, Alice in Wonderland, Maleficent, Dumbo, and more to come) Considering that this live-action version of the Lion King is part of a larger movement, some impact is lost. it‚Äôs not as ‚Äúspecial‚Äù knowing there are so many others. The result of this remake is mixed. On one hand, the visuals are gorgeous. On the other hand, this remake doesn‚Äôt add enough value to the original to justify its own existence.

5278,970527632,Mubina V,"Absolutely loved this film. I'm a huge fan of the original and can say that this movie lived up to the majesty of the 1994 classic. The updated and photorealistic visuals and stunning CGI facilitated beautiful scenes that actually improved on some of the scenes in the original (for instance, the Circle of Life sequence in the beginning of the film was greatly improved by the enhancements of CGI). You really feel like you are ""in"" the African savanna when you watch this in 3D and IMAX. As for the acting, I absolutely loved Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen as Timone and Pumbaa. They were hilarious and a wonderful throwback to the original beloved characters. Simba as a young cub was absolutely adorable. The songs as well were wonderful and Beyonc√©'s glorious vocals in songs like ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" and the new addition ""Spirit"" were emotional and empowering. Donald Glover is a great singer too and was a sympathetic adult Simba. And last but not least it was a treat having the great James Earl Jones back as Mufasa. The 1994 classic was perfection but this version holds its own too. ",2019-07-28T21:42:08.239Z,1.0

5281,978176002,Max M,"First of all, a summary: The movie has stunning visuals (it is pretty much photorealistic), great voice actors (John Oliver as Zazu works especially well), the dialog is, in my opinion, a slight improvement over the original and the plot is unchanged from its great original. Hence the five-star rating.

Plot and dialog: The movie follows the original almost scene for scene. There are slight changes to the dialog, which are an improvement in my opinion. There is a little more depth to the relationship between Scar and the hyenas, a lot more character for Shenzi, a little stronger comedy overall and more depth to the relationship between Scar and the other lions.

Atmosphere: The atmosphere of the scenes is quite similar to the corresponding scenes in the original movie, so mostly lighthearted. There are the most differences when Scar and the hyenas are involved because these characters have become a little scarier and less goofy. The scene that involves Scar asking Zazu to sing songs to him is completely gone, instead, we have some new scenes of Scars rule that show his conflicts with the other lions and a dramatic scene that depicts Nalas escape from Scar and the hyenas to look for help (which leads to her finding out that Simba is alive). This is another example of Scar and the hyenas being portrayed as more threatening.

Visuals: As said above, the visuals are absolutely stunning and the animals look almost photorealistic.  This makes scenes that live of their colorful depiction of Africa even more impactful. The one downside is, that the more realistic depiction of the lions and the hyenas makes it take half a second longer to tell whether the lion on-screen is Nala or Sarabi, or cub Simba or cub Nala, Shenzi or another hyena. After about a second it becomes clear though. Action and night scenes are a little more affected by this.

Music: The one area in which I consider the movie a slight downgrade. The great songs of the original movie are still played in this version, but I think the original has a better version of ""Be Prepared"" and slightly better singing in other songs. This might be just personal preference.",2019-07-28T21:38:04.288Z,1.0

It felt like they just put voice overs on the animal's; there are scenes that are unnecessarily dragged out and i found myseld thinking why did they have to remake this movie. One thing that infuriates me is how they changed scar, he was my favourite villian growimg up and they changed him into this flat character. Scar came across as cold and bland, whilst the original had a much more rounded and interesting personality. He had no nore sarcastic comment or posh like attidue; even the gyenas had lost their fun attitude. The worst character change was rafiki, he use to be this fun, a bit crazy old baboon and now, he has less personality that actual baboons. They cut scenes that were funny such has rafiki hitting simba on the end.

Hint spoilers: But I was surprised Scar wanted Sarabi as his queen that was new and now I know how Nala was able to escape priderock to find help I mean I was tense when Scar almost caught her but thankfully that zazu was able to distract him.

You'd think since technology has come so far now that we would get an amazing 2019 version of the Lion King; with that said this movie was not great. I can't even say this was an 'okay' movie.. they cut scenes and added different ones that did nothing for the plot (SPOILER: the opening scene dragged out way too long, Be Prepared was shortened so much). They didn't add anything to the story, granted they did some re-writes that I approved of.. Some of the voice actors I liked for the rolls they did but others didn't seem to capture the emotion of the characters they were playing. Emotionless, Boring and all the old bonds no longer existed (SPOILER: Scar had with the hyenas it was not there, even though the hyenas were idiots in the original lion king, Scar was shown to have a bond with them) It added nothing but filler to pad the movie run time and I feel like my time was wasted on this movie. This movie just doesn't stand up.. Only reason it's getting 2 stars from me and not 1 star is for the okay acting cast plus how I loved the graphical look in it, that's the only thing they really nailed...",2019-07-28T17:26:10.653Z,0.0

The Lion King is another attempt from Disney to make some more money off of already successful blockbusters. The original Lion KIng was colorful uplifting, had great musical numbers, and had actors that fit the parts well. This one's a different story. Let's take a look. 
First: With animation the characters can cry and show emotion. That's how they made the buffalo stampede scene so emotional and dramatic. In this one you can't have live action animals show emotion (cry) so you don't get that same feeling when Simba's father dies. You feel the complete opposite. You almost tell Simba to deal with it. 
Second: The actors added a lifeless voice contribution. Example: In the original the guy who played Timon the wisecracking weasle gave the character his humorous likeabilty. Whoever plays Timon in this debacle just didn't have the voice. He didn't give Timbone didn't have the comic persona. And overall just didn't sound like Timon. Seth Rogen i'll give credit. He was able to use his voice to sound close to the original Pumbaa. 
Third: The film's musical numbers were rushed and didn't have the upbeat originality of the predcessor. Mostly because of live action's lack of expression. Be Prepared is the most notable example. In the original the song is long, dramatic, and colorful. And it has all the colors, patterns, and dancing. With this one it's dark, Scar doesn't sound like he's singing and, it's very depressing and downbeat. 
Fourth: In the orginal when Simba's dad comes in from the clouds and tells him who he is and what his destiny it's the most powerful part of the movie. And you can see him, so you get the full effect. In this one you can't see the father (all you see are a bunch of clouds that have a lion's face) and it doesn't have that impact. You feel unsatisfied. 
To sum it up in a few short words it's dull, lifeless, lacks music and humor, and has cheesy special effects. Next time Disney! ",2019-07-28T15:57:58.910Z,0.0

5485,977339671,Kevin J,"So thoughts on Lion King: I suppose it's a fine movie if you feel like seeing the exact movie as you did before in different packaging.

THE GOOD: Of course it looks pretty! The photorealism is incredible. Timon and Pumbaa always stole the show when they were on screen. They had energy and charisma and felt authentic. Beyonce's performance was fine, and actually outdid Donald Glover unfortunately. Scar was solid.

THE BAD: Songs were meh at best. Be Prepared was an utter failure. Can you Feel the Love tonight was too modern radio and didn't happen at night, so didn't make sense. Beyonce's song for Simba's return takes you out of a moment that should be emotionally fulfilling. Actually many places that should have been emotionally poignant fell flat throughout. 

Overall this film didn't bring enough new material to make it worthwhile in the long run. Sure it's fun to see what some of your favorite animated characters might look like together in nature, but that's about where it stops. It's virtually a strict retelling, and it does a good job of bringing the story to life, but in the end it's less compelling.",2019-07-28T14:53:57.955Z,0.0

5506,978175468,Fox M,"This movie can be summarized by one word: WHY?!
Why was it ever made? Why are people still going to see it? And why is the audience score at the time of this review so high (88%)? Are people afraid of admitting it's awful? Do people at this time and age really think this passes for a 'good movie'?
The ORIGINAL Lion King is a masterpiece of animation and voice-acting and score and songwriting and storytelling. It's as close as it gets to being 'perfect'.
This 2019 remake is NOT anything of that. Sure, the photo-realistic scenery is impressive, from a technological point of view, but for all their realism there's something off with the way the animals move! On top of that, the animals are incapable of conveying emotion and expressions the way people or a cartoon can. Not even James Earl Jones can save it with his legendary voice-acting. Beyonc√© can't voice-act. I'm sorry, I love her, but voice-acting is not her cup of tea! That said, I think Donald Glover did make a better adult Simba; I always thought the original was a bit of a wuss, and Glover brings more authority to the character.
The movie is padded with 30 extra minutes of useless/lengthier scenes, and for all their amazing photorealism, couldn't they have had a more pretty Africa? The whole thing is in brown and earthen tones and I saw glimpses of the bloom that plagued videogames that claimed to be photorealistic a few years ago.

5531,795081994,Alan W,"Jon Favreau directs again, after his successful 2016 remake of The Jungle Book, with technological advances that can render super-photo-realistic images of animals and wildlife on-screen, which almost justify this remake, but it also proves to be a double-edged sword. With the result looking amazingly real like an Attenborough documentary, the action sequences, which are now simply visceral and stunning to look at, benefit the most from this upgrade. However, when they start talking and singing, I feel as if I'm on a bad hallucinogenic trip, something The Jungle Book remake somehow managed to sidestep. While songs can be played out in the background, that's a lot harder to do for the talking, no matter how they try to soften them up with camera angles and editing that avoid showing mouth movements directly or for long periods of time. The main story and plotting and Elton John's songs remain so faithful to the original (film & Broadway show), it's like a scene-by-scene remake; and narrative developments are on the fast side, often at the expense of proper characterization. The voice cast reflects Disney's new found racial and cultural sensitivities (Donald Glover instead of Matthew Broderick; Chiwetel Ejiofor replacing Jeremy Irons), with the exception of a few white comedians sidekicks who are funny when they go a little off-script, but the personality of their voices are so distinctive, you still think of them more as Seth Rogen and John Oliver than Pumbaa and Zazu. This is Disney's third remake in a row since March's Dumbo and whilst their box office takings may have justify the exercise, you can't help but feel disappointed, if not despair, at the dearth of originality and you miss the original animation's charm and innocence. Sometimes just because you can, doesn't necessarily mean you should. ",2019-07-28T13:28:11.977Z,0.0

And then, to top it off, the overrated Beyonce gets a her own new song in the Lion King on Simba's travel back to the pride lands. Bullshit. They took all the well known actors of today, with a few exceptions, and totally disrespected the passion the went into the making of the original. Look at Disney, destroying childhood's left and right these days. They butchered this and as far as I'm concerned this live action remake doesn't exist. So thanks for nothing.

But I have to say that if I had not experienced the original in all its splendor, I might have not felt the same way. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but the music was not highlighted -- one of the best movie scores ever! And the animals, being done by computer (don't know the technology of this), lacked emotion.  Therefore, to me, it lost allot of the humor which made it so great (Nathan lane's timmone was priceless!)

The problem with having a ton of soloists, is that they don't play well together most of the time. They relied too heavily on beyonce over singing like she was trying to impress the judges at the voice, and donald glover trying his best, which was lack luster. Even john oliver lost points in my book for being associated with this at best fumble. It was overly safe and yet so self absorbed that it fails to capture even a moment of my attention.

The Disney Cashcow is back and looking more realistic than your local zoo.

Pros:
The beautiful visuals. 
Voice Acting
Keeps the same great story that has captivated us 25 years ago. 
Hans Zimmer's score was pretty much untouched. 
Still some of the best music found in any animated picture.

Cons:
Rafiki role was all but deleted
Compared to the Original the facial expressions are non-existent 
Some character interpretations are a bit off. 
Missed opportunities‚Ä¶

Story: 4
I would be completely baffled if you haven't already seen the original film, but if you haven't here is a quick rundown. Mufasa is king of pride rock and has a younger brother (Scar) who is technically next in line to be king. Mufasa has a cub (Simba) who is now the true successor to the throne. Scar tricks Simba into going to a dangerous place called the Elephant Graveyard, in hopes that he is killed by the denizens that live there. The plan fails when Mufasa gets there in time to save Simba and Nala (Female lion cub / Simba's friend). Scar then plots with the Hyenas to Kill Mufasa and Simba by creating a stampede using wildebeest. This plan only partially succeeds by killing Mufasa. Unknowingly to Scar, Simba manages to escape the hyenas and flees the pride lands. In the aftermath of Mufasa's death, Scar takes over as king. Simba is found by Timon and Pumba where they teach him that you can't change the past so don't worry about it (""Hakuna Matata""). Nala Escapes the pride lands to look for help because Scar and the Hyenas are destroying it. Nala eventually runs into Simba where she tries to convince him to come back and take his rightful place as king. He refuses. Rafiki soon after runs into Simba and, with the help from Mufasa teaches Simba you can't run from your past, you have to learn from it. Simba makes is way back to the pride lands where he challenges scar, learns the truth about his father's death and ascends as the new King. 
The Lion King has all the chemical makeup for an excellent film and the remake keeps these attributes. I just wish they took advantage of this and expanded a bit more on the story.

Visual: 4.5
The original film was an animation marvel, even by today's standard. Smooth animation bright and vibrant colors, expressive facial expression that mimic the voice actors, and the illusions of real-life camera work / tricks. 
The 2019 version of the film is no slouch on the eye candy. The hyperrealism makes the film look like a Nat-Geo documentary. If you thought the CGI in the Jungle Book remake was stunning, you haven't seen anything yet. 
While the visuals pretty much make every other CGI animated film look last gen, there is one thing that kinda sticks out. Part of what made the classic Lion King animation stand out is the expressiveness through body language and facial expression. If you are looking for that this time around you will be fresh out of luck. Besides mouth moving while talking and singing, these cats look and act like, well‚Ä¶ Big cats. Its just part of the deal, Jon Favreau and Disney were clearly going for ""What If"" The Lion King happened on Planet Earth. 

Audio: 4
There is no denying that the 1994 cast would be just about impossible to live up to, and honestly it was. Don't get me wrong though, the cast for the 2019 film is still amazing, and well done. I think the approach this time was to interpret the characters your own way, and all of them did a pretty good job at it. James Earl Jones is the only original cast member to reprise his role and he was brilliant. JD McCrary played young Simba and was great. He performed the number ""I just can't wait to be king"" and he did it better than the original if you ask me. Also his after the stampede / Mufasa Death scene was heart wrenching. Maybe even more than Johnathan Taylor Thomas's performance. Chiwetel Ejiofor played a good Scar but Jeremy Irons left some huge shoes to fill. I think I will have to say Jeremey had the better performance. Beyonc√©'s Nala was on point. I was a little nervous that she would be too much Beyonce if that makes any sense. Donald Glover also had some big shoes to fill. Every movie Matthew Broderick played in his voice just screams Simba to me, but I have to admit I love Glover's interpretation of the character. It feels like a up dated version of the original. They made the right choice going with Childish Gambino because he can sing. His rifting at the end of ""Hakuna Matata"" was pure gold and he was getting better and better. I hated the song had to end. Much like Donald Glover, Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner are like updated versions of the originals. Ernie Sabella, and Nathen Lane are Pumba and Timon. In my opinion, and Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner feels the same.
Soundtrack wise The Lion King 2019 is once again a masterpiece. Hans Zimmer pretty much just bedazzled his work and, its music to my ears. If the original score made you feel like the orchestra is playing in the same room as you, the new and improved version puts you right were the conductor is standing and you are surrounded by blends of harmonies and melodies. 
Beyonc√© and Donald Glover lend their voices to the movie classic ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" and it came out very well done. I prefer it over the original movie version. I have to admit that Disney did miss an opportunity though, I would have loved to here a Beyonce Rendition of ""Shadowland"". The new song ""Spirit"" is pretty good though and made it into the film.  

Final Thoughts 
The Lion King 2019 is a great film, not perfect‚Ä¶  but these remakes usually aren't. Most of its bigger faults I was capable of getting over by being immersed by photorealism and Hans Zimmer's intoxicating score. A lot of critics of the film state not being about to get past the lack of facial expression. The thing is Jon Favreau / Disney wanted to go with the Hyper realism and in reality big cats don't have facial expression so it would look really unnatural or comical (think Alex The Lion from the Madagascar Series). They also complained that it was basically a prettier carbon copy or the original. To me that's more of a complement because the 1994 classic is one of the greatest animated films period. I still have to admit that I would have liked them to expand on character interactions more. It felt like the moment I warm up to Donald Golver's Simba he was already running back to the pride lands. I feel like they should have done something similar to what they did in The Lion King 1 ¬Ω where they added scenes. 
Overall II highly recommend seeing the film. Ignore the critics especially if you enjoyed the original movie.

5663,941919463,Matthew D,"An entertaining but soulless version that mimics the original without mimicking what made it work in the first place. Often times, I was bored throughout this film, which is strange since I loved the original. This version extends scenes to the point of mediocrity. The music is the same and still sounds great (minus one song that got completely changed for the worse).
The visuals look incredible, but they're also the film's biggest flaw. The animated film works better because it is an animated film. This film tries to go for realism but it just doesn't quite work.

This was a fun film and did make me cry, but I still felt a little let down at certain moments. I did not like the additional music during sequences where Simba discovers himself and has to reclaim pride rock. That additional Beyonc song was a complete distraction and many of the vocals played with running up and down the scales way too often it took away from the classic we all came to love. Some of the writing fell short of my expectations as well. Lions...ATTACK! Absurd.

However, this version did not do justice to the original movie or even the Broadway version. Voice acting was mediocre at best. Comedic timing was off throughout the movie. Some actors just sounded like they really didn‚Äôt want to be there. Seth Rogan did a great rendition of Pumba, but Beyonc√© as Nala completely ruined the movie for me. Her acting was horrible, and she butchered every song she sang. Like the national anthem, just sing the song please, do not try to change it to be your interpretation of a classic.

5848,978174632,J R,"Best part of the movie was from Timon and Pumba, until Nala finds Simba with them. Everything else wasn't very good...and the lack of expression, bc of the realism (which is beautiful) doesn't let emotion ever really come across. 

Nala meeting Simba, as adults, was so bad. Dialogue was rushed and paced awkwardly...and because it's Beyonce, they had to give her some more things to do and had her say ""Lions, attack!"" which made my theatre laugh, at what was originally an important moment - when Scar confesses and Simba starts fighting him. In the original, the lions just started attacking the hyenas, bc it made sense.


Eichner stole the show though, him and Rogen were the best part.",2019-07-28T01:06:58.715Z,0.0

Beyonce's name was tossed around a lot in the theater,and people were very excited for her character, Nala. There were suspenseful scenes, but nothing that merits an uproar, no pun intended. The facial expressions may not have been as vivid as the cartoon animated version, but that's because this is a live-action film. It would be outrageous to nitpick over such a thing. You could still see emotion on the characters faces, especially in their eyes. It was enjoyable for all ages. Three generations of my family enjoyed the movie.

As lifelike as animals may seem, characters lack the essence that once gave them life. Eyes are unexpressive, performances rarely match the characters onscreen, and even with all its technical brilliance, I remember the few moments it missteps more than I do its many major visual triumphs.

Its rare to put together such an incredible cast, a great previous movie, and some of the most incredible visual in the world and still mess this up; unfortunately that is what happened with ""The Lion King."" The whole time I was watching the movie I was waiting for it to begin. The beginning till the last 15 minutes could have been summarized in 20 minutes, and about half the movie was all about passing the time instead of advancing the plot. It ended in the most cliche way imaginable. Also I really think the type of animation they used was incredible but placed in the wrong movie. I much preferred the first lion kings animation which was more of a cartoon. I came in with so much hope, but at least Seth Rogens voice helped elevate the movie a little bit.

The visual effects were almost flawless, and the story fits the medium well. although to get such great effect, the lighting was always the same, with setting/rising sun which got quite annoying.

The storyline went pretty much unchanged, which is a good thing in my opinion. However, some change would be welcome as this felt like a lazy copy-paste of the original. The CGI is amazing for a few minutes but it doesn't help the movie overcome it's major problem: lack of emotion. Despite using the same story this adaptation failed to capture the sadness and sense of triumph the original did, which left me walking out of the movie disappointed. In conclusion, The Lion King is a aesthetically pleasing remake that doesn't add anything to the storyline and loses the emotions that made the original film great. ",2019-07-27T20:47:07.489Z,0.0
5974,978174242,Jill C,"I thought this was a pretty disappointing remake of a classic Disney film.   The chemistry was touch and go throughout the movie that made it seem very awkward- not at all natural.  The cast of voices- while very talented were poorly selected, or terribly executed- as if they worked as individuals and not together.
JD McCrary did a very good job as young Simba but some of the innocence that was brought to the animated role by Jonathan Taylor Thomas was lost. 
Seth Rogen did really well as Pumba and James Earl Jones is an irreplaceable voice- they were my only real joy. 

The worst part was the remake of ""Can you feel the love tonight"" a lovely song turned into a competion of vocals- like nails on a chalkboard.
Beyonce's voice is absolutely beautiful as is Donald Glover's voice- but not together and not for this song. Maybe take a lesson from the original or even the Pentatonix cover of how voices should work together in a duet.

My hope is that Disney fixes the awkward and does a re-release.",2019-07-27T20:43:33.005Z,0.0

6011,978173760,Kat B,"This adaptation of the original Lion King is a sprawling, visual and emotional masterpiece!
I loved every aspect of this film - from the incredible live action, real animal feel of it to the luminous cinemetography (if one could call that), to the score. I cried when Mufasa died, I held my daughter tight while looking at the star filled sky, and I cheered when Simba realized his true destiny! What else could one ask from this film? I even liked the fact that the storyline did not venture far from the original narrative. I thought the actors did exceedingly well bringing these beloved characters to life and that Beyonce brought out a brave, strong and fierce Nahla. The iconic voice of James Earl Jones was amazingly still as powerful and resonant as it was all those years ago, and I was as enthralled as I was then. Some complain that they miss the facial expressions from the original; but c'mon...it was an animated, cartoon. How deeply were we really connecting to facial expressions? Although it was CGI, it was done so well it actually felt more authentic in some ways. I thought the very real look of the animals enhanced the beautiful story in all its nuances.

Walt Disney would be spinning in his grave by now if he saw what his movies were reduced to these soulless, cash-grabbing insults to the beloved classic disney animated films.

What was the point of even attempting to put Be Prepared in this movie if you were just going to do that? Also concerning Chiwetel, not sure why they had him sound like Mufasa at times, it was a little confusing (You'll understand if you actually go to see it.). Do you know why a lot of people are bothered by this version? Because it is basically a word for word, shot for shot remake, and there was so much of a disconnect and lack of emotion. Why even do a remake? How difficult is it to convey the same emotion from the original? Apparently very. How is it possible to have James Earl Jones not sound powerful when speaking? He's the same person who voiced Mufasa all those years ago. So how is that possible? (None of these negative things are the actors/actresses faults btw.) 

 The good part about this though is the visuals. It is absolutely beautiful. They did do some cute things that could almost make up for all the problems, but they don't really.",2019-07-27T05:27:57.890Z,0.0

Also, there is this weird small talk crap that just adds fluff and interrupts the timing of the movie, it completely pulls you out of the scene (if you're actually able to engage). I don't understand why some shots are modern carbon copies of the original but the voices of some characters are so ordinary that you wouldn't be able to differentiate one from another.

It seemed like the actors came in to work and put a regular 9-5 shift and went home. No passion. Really came off as a remake money grab. 100% disappointment.

Apparently the director wanted to show emotion only through body language, which he failed at, and told the voice actors to tone it down. This resulted in an almost emotionless movie. I am very familiar with cats, both wild and domestic, and they show a lot more emotion than what we see in this movie. Watch the eyes and ears, the whiskers and mouth. Very little emotion is conveyed, even though felines naturally have very expressive faces. The voice acting is a bit flat, even Mufasa! Beyonce is NOT a voice actor. Poor casting. I've always loved Sarabi, even though she is a minor character, but she was ruined in this movie. At one point she says she isn't scared of Scar.. I know she isn't. But SHOW, don't TELL.

6406,976256175,Aaron G,"In Jun. 1994, The Lion King made its first debut into theaters, and since then it has been widely popular and more musical going into the 21st Century. But the new one that I watched today was very, very wonderful, delightful, and looked realistically good. Mind you, I was not there for the original Lion King when it came in theaters in June of '94 because when I was one year old I would stay with family and watch educational programs/channels on TV. But somewhere near '99 or 2001, I was able to watch Lion King on VHS at my elementary school. Movie-wise I like both versions of The Lion King equally and just the same; music is the same. I was also there for the 3D Lion King when it came out in 2011. Either way, animation was spot-on with both versions; storyboard made sense; loved the music.

Then the scene in which Simba is supposed to see his dad in the clouds was cut out and normal clouds were show instead, which completely killed the atmosphere and importance of that scene. We don't see Simba falling down in those flowers and all the scenes when he's trying to figure out who he is. All of the character development was thrown away to make room for cheap gags. The expository shots are way longer than they need to be but the really important shots for when Simba reunites with Nila and them falling in love are cut waaaaay too short.

6450,977683833,Kyle A,"All my life, The Lion King was my favorite Disney movie and still is to this day. I've always anticipated what a ""live action"" version of this story would be like. Perhaps I should've stuck with the original and no remakes‚Ä¶
This movie is a visual achievement and there Is no denying it. The animals all look photo realistic even though they are 100% CGI. For the most part, this movie was the movie I wanted to see. It is almost quite literally a shot for shot remake of the Lion King which I loved. This didn't change big parts of the story like Aladdin did and it stayed very faithful to the original. Some of the shots they recreated put big smiles on my face and made me reflect a lot on my childhood. It was great to listen to James Earl Jones again as Mufasa and Seth Rogen as Pumba was fantastic casting. This movie gave me the story I wanted to see and the one that I know and love. This movie gave me the fleshed-out characters that I know and love. Unfortunately, it lacked any and all of the energy and emotion that the first one had.
One of the biggest positives of this film, was also its biggest issues. The photo realistic design of these animals is truly incredible and what the effects crew did with that was terrific. But, with the animals looking so real, it takes away expression and emotion which brings me to my next problem. I don't know if the voice actors are to blame, or if they were just given dialogue and told not to have much emotion behind their voice because this film, felt soulless. In the original, Mufasa's death was a horrifying and sad scene to witness. Scar lived in the moment and cherished his opportunity to kill his brother and you could feel the tension in his menacing voice. As Mufasa fell to his death, we saw the true horror in Simba's face as his dad died before his eyes. In this movie, Simba just looked like a baby lion roaring and sounded like a kid who dropped his ice cream on the ground. That's just one example among an entire 118 minute runtime. Somethings about the original that they changed were completely nerfing Raficki. He wasn't even close to being as good as he was in the original. He was just bland, humorless, and seemed to not care that Mufasa and Simba were both dead. All of the songs felt empty and bland ESPECIALLY be prepared which was heavily nerfed. I'm also confused as to why they didn't recast Jeremy Irons as Scar because I'm sorry, Chiwetel Ejiofor didn't do it for me as Scar. Shall I even say that James Earl Jones even felt tired delivering some of his lines as Mufasa. But again, who do I blame? The too good CGI or the voice acting? Also some of the stuff they added did nothing new for the story. There's an extended scene of Nala sneaking out of pride rock to get help and it goes on waaay too long. There's also an extended scene of Timon and Pumba singing ""The lion sleeps tonight"" which while charming, it wasn't necessary. I would've preferred that we get some back story on Scar on how he got the scar in the first place as he mentions early in the film. That would've filled the runtime so much better in my opinon.
As you can see this film frustrated me very much. Although there is a lot to like in this movie, that being the characters and the story and visuals, but it all feels so empty. Disney went 0 for 3 this year with live action and after messing up Aladdin and The Lion King, two favorites of mine, I say Disney should call it quits with these movies. But hey, they've both made over 1 billion dollars so unfortunately, we will continue to get more of these shameless cash grabs. The Lion King ever so disappointingly gets, a C+

6461,977650966,Kazi F,"Credit where credit is due: I can't even begin to imagine the how Disney was able to accomplish the technical achievement that went behind creating the breathtaking visuals of this movie. However, at the end of the day it falls under the category of ""their animators were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."" Hete are 10 Reasons, in no particular order, why you shouldn't fork over your hard earned moneys to watch the new photorealistic remake of Lion King:

1. It's photorealistic which means you'll quickly come to the realization that irl animals have very limited range of facial expressions, unlike a cartoon where, regardless of species, you can clearly tell how a character is feeling through exaggerated features. So basically Simba has the exact same f***ing expression(pictured above) when he's palling around with Nala as he does when he's mourning over the loss of Mufasa's dead ass. Moreover, as you may or may not have noticed, animals don't usually dance and prance around in nature so a musical number such as ""I just can't wait to be king"" is just way less fun
2. Apparently Chiwetel Ejiofor is too cool to sing, so my personal favourite musical number ""Be Prepared"" was replaced by a little recruitment seminar
3. No luau Timon.
4. Everything is the same as the original but worse.
5. You can use the money you would have used to watch this to buy a DVD/Blu-Ray version of Lion King 1994 and have a much better time
6. All the characters are devoid of personalities because, once again, irl animals have very limited range of facial expressions, so at any given moment whenever two characters are interacting with each other without the presence of dialogue it just seems like they're blankly staring at each other. What's that Simba, you're thinking about boning Nala later? Couldn't tell, cuz you're a f***ing lion who's incapable of conveying emotions through your face
7. So I read this article which said that lions that have darker manes are typically more masculine because the darker manes are caused by extra testosterone pumping through their bodies and so they're usually more physically endowed thereby considered the alpha of their respective prides and to account for this it looks like they made scar's mane lighter? Idk it might just be me, I read this like 5 mins before watching the movie and it may have skewed my perception a tad. 
8. The once malicious, conniving Shakespearean villain that was Scar has been rendered a bland, soulless echo of his former self because of, you guessed it, the limitations of photorealism
9. It's not even live action like the other remakes. Everything was done in a computer anyway, so like, what even is the point? 
10. Stop encouraging Disney to make more of these by giving them your money. THEY ARE RELEASING 4 LIVE ACTION REMAKES IN 2019 ALONE AND THEY MUST BE STOPPED

6468,916219875,Justin C,"The visual effects are incredible, but everything else leaves a lot to be desired. The story is okay, but the script dialogue and voice acting seems watered-down. The music tries to compete with the original, but the vocal talent has mostly been replaced by mediocre singing attempts from stage comedians.

For a child, this movie should entertain just fine. For those who grew up with the animated original, it'll just seem like a normal ride in the car.

6551,978172537,Carlos Z,"Awful. To say the least. Honestly the only good thing about this movie was the beautiful backgrounds such as the jungle scenery and chasing down rafiki that was cool. The biggest and most upsetting part of this movie was the  atrocious voice acting. There was no passion no bravado nothing. It was if they were reading it off the script. The only person that let personality come through and played the character wonderfully was Seth Rogan playing as Pumba that was funny. Also credit to Billy Eichner for a good Timon. JD Mcrary needs to stay far far far away from voice acting as he was plainly awful as young simba. There was no emotion no feeling of guilt when Mufasa died no feeling of fear when Mufasa needs to speak to him after almost getting himself and Nala killed in the elephant graveyard. Young Nala was mediocre. Donald Glover as much as I love him was simply okay. Had some good moments but was not into it. Beyonc√© ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'm sorry no hell no. Please god get her away from voice acting as she is terrible too. Also the stupid and unnecessary spirit song when they are running back to the pridelands was stupid and again unnecessary. This Movie if you can call it that is a shame to even be called a remake of the master piece that the original still is. One more thing who the hell thought it was an awesome idea to put John freaking Oliver as Zazu??!!! Ugh again voice acting is what killed this movie for me. The animation was okay but if it's all cgi why make it so expressionless? Add some Disney magic and make it better. Throughly disappointed. James Earl Jones got too old. Or wasn't directed correctly because he voice isn't stern. Doesn't have the same impact. So yeah for me it's a one star rated movie and that's only because of the beautiful jungle scene. Everything else was trash shame on the voice acting Disney should have done better. They focus too much on ""star studded voice acting"" I'm sorry they are trash. ",2019-07-26T18:04:10.107Z,0.0

One thing with making the animals look so real is that they lose the expression of emotion on their faces, making the dramatic scenes just ever so slightly underwhelming. 
If the music doesn't make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up then this film is WASTED on you!

The nostalgia of the music and the realistic visuals have really mounted to a cinematic event. Timon and Pumba have been completely rewritten so the jokes and gags are unexpected and fresh that kept me entertained. The opening of the circle of life brought a tear to my eye, just due to the shear beauty and meaningfulness of the wonderful planet we are living in. My only negatives for this film is due to the style of animation I Just Can't wait to. Be King and Be Prepared we're toned down from the larger than life and expressionism displayed in the original. Personally the original will always be the best, but out of the string of remakes Disney has released this year, this one is the best. ",2019-07-26T14:12:32.446Z,1.0

6648,906794753,Matt G,"My question going into the latest ""pay-us-for-your-nostalgia"" Disney-remake was, ""Why do we need this? What new can it bring?"". Technically, the CGI animation is impressively state-of-the-art and new. Otherwise, my worst fears were warranted. It's not just similar to its source material but is 100% the same in almost every aspect. From moment one, when the iconic ""NAAAH SA-VIN-YAAAH!"" bursts forth, I realized they were so beholden to the '94 classic they didn't even bother rerecording that vocal. It sets the stage for both the larger things (story beats / scenes), as well as the smaller things (specific line deliveries), to be a lazy karaoke tune. So frustratingly unimaginative, it makes 2019's Aladdin look like a feat of original storytelling.
Thankfully, the greatness of the story is left untouched, though it was already plenty great without being redone. The few things that are changed don't expand the story, but just extend scenes past the point of reasonable story economics. We're forced to sit through self-congratulatory animation montages that are useless beyond ""look what we did!""
Crowds seem to be going for the cast, and many of those performances are the highlights. Listening to Glover & Beyonce sing together is special, Scar is decently rendered, and Rogen & Eichner offer the most unique and successful moments. Still, with dialogue so slavish, you can sense the actors desperately trying not to copy what they grew up hearing.
Honestly, even the technical brilliance is often a hindrance. By making the animals photoreal, we take away individual personalities, physical nuances, and even facial expressions, all of which help us relate to their plight. So, again I ask, why do we need this?",2019-07-26T14:01:25.925Z,0.0

And the fights were truly inspiring I believe that if they had the same dialogues or at least the most importan ones... Like when mufasa died, or the beginning with scar and also when simba spoke with the money, those were very important parts yet they changed the dialogues and put something simple and boring.

The animals did not physically emote. If you mute the movie you'd have no idea if they were sad or upset. Their mouths barely moved when the talked. The scenes fell flat and were cut short to add new scenes (ie the poop scene). It was not an emotional movie like the original. The Lion King 2 Simba's pride is even better than this imo.some of the characters fell flat(imo Nala,timon,pumba,young Simba). Overall I felt the movie was rushed and not very good. I urge everyone to watch the original if they have not,it is sooooo much better. Disney seemed to try to make this too realistic looking, forgetting these are singing animals...and focused on having too many big names in their movie. What happened?!",2019-07-26T12:28:58.048Z,0.0

If you take out all of the fun and color, what you're left with is 2019's The Lion King. Like many remakes, this is a wholly unnecessary one. It doesn't tread any new ground and what's changed simply isn't for the better.
It represents a disturbing trend in Hollywood, and especially from Disney, to just remake things that were already good. Why? Profit. That's it. That's the bottom line. Outside of its technical achievements there's no real care or heart put into this film, and it shows. It's just the original, but not as good.

6752,784969405,Tyler Y,"Tragic, Shakespearean, violent are words to describe the new Lion King. I was 4 when the movie was in theaters. For 20+ years this has been my favorite movie. In the first 5 minutes of the film, I became disconnected. There are funny jabs and adlibs from Eric, Key, and Seth that help save some of the lighthearted comedy that the original was full of. It lacked the emotional coaster of the 1994 cartoon. I left feeling empty. The scenes were drawn out wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy too long, and the songs were so far from the originals that they seem like techno compared to rock and roll. I went in with an open mind and left with a broken heart.Although The final scene was leaps and bounds better then the original;  My final thought was, if you want to take the expression and the goofiness, out of the charters to make it seem more real, then why don't the lions suffocate the enemy, and where is the blood. I get the director wanting something different, but if they would have just made a copy paste remake of the original with the same visuals with the added creativity of the new roll, they would have had the same turnout without the pissed off feedback. Now we have to wait another 20+ years for them to fix it.  P.S. Be prepared (my favorite scene/song) was reduced to a poem with horrible sustained notes, which made me want to plug my ears.

6762,915900746,Yash B,"The 1994 classic version of ""The Lion King"" is still my favorite animated movie of all time to this day. Naturally, I was a little skeptical when I heard they were remaking the movie into a live-action (or in this case, really good CGI). It didn't feel particularly necessary and definitely came off as a cash grab. There were certain things in this new version I liked a lot less than the original, but I think as a whole, I still enjoyed it. The movie plays it safe in terms of the story and is almost a scene for scene remake, which I liked. I think the story is perfect and there was no reason to change any of the events in the story and for the most part its the same movie in a lot of ways. I liked most of the songs, except for a few that I felt were a lot more effective in the original. However, even though a few of the songs aren't as well done, Hans Zimmer's score is still unforgettable and effective. The film's greatest strength is the stunning visual effects. If there's any reason to see this movie in theaters, its the visuals. Everything does look pretty lifelike and it really was a treat for the eyes. What this movie severely lacks is the genuine emotional center the original movie had. The characters are realistic and therefore aren't able to show emotion in their faces in moments where the animation could. Also, the movie features a lot of the exact same dialogue but a lot of it doesn't really have the same punch as the original. Sometimes certain things that characters say feel flat and lifeless here, and the exact same words had an entirely different effect in the original. If you can overlook some of the movie's flaws, it still has some moments that are handled very well. Overall, while I don't see myself watching this movie again because I think the original is far better, it was enjoyable to experience this timeless story again in theaters.",2019-07-26T06:48:51.318Z,1.0

1. Do you really get a directing credit for copying an animated movie scene by scene?! I guess you do when you clip the funny parts out and add scenes that do not even flow or add anything to the movie. I love Jon Favreau but what in the world!!!

2. The voice choices were not right. You have trained broadway voices replaced by some good actors with mediocre voices. 

3.  The exact lines were used from the original movie but the inflection of which word they chose to inflect was completely wrong. The original script and choice of emphasis was right on the money. Just because you change the inflection does not make it better, it made it worse. 

4. If you brought back James Earl Jones (right choice) let him do his original style. And then bring back Jeremy Irons too! And Nathan Lane  and Ernie Sabella and even Whoopi!

5. The music...I just cant! Be prepared was my jam and you ruined it!!!

6. I loved the idea but the execution was lazy.

Quite a few differences regarding Scar and the hyenas as they are most mostly void of humor this time around.

I wasnt a fan of some of the character design changes (Scars fur wasnt orange and his mane wasnt black, Rafiki had white stripes instead of solid blue) and the just lazy changes (What happened to Ed? The hyena? He was wonderful and I was waiting for him to appear. Seemed to have been replaced with the personal space hyenas). Also, beacuse it was realistic, the expressions we got to see from characters in the original were completely gone in this remake (When young Simba turns and sees the stampede running toward him, in the original you can see the horror on his face, while in this he looks no different than his resting face.) In this remake they also did Scar, the best Disney villain, dirty. I was SO disappointed in the Be Prepared song, normally one of the best parts of the movie, was just....... Scar walking around and taking, not even singing. Overall, good movie, but way worse than the original.",2019-07-26T04:21:55.447Z,1.0

6837,875992405,Ariel J,"Honestly, I was really looking forward to this movie- then the second trailer came out and I was like... well, hmmm- I trust this. It's gonna be better than that, right? 
Well, the day it came out, I went in an afternoon showing in an AMC IMAX, plopped down and the opening song, The Circle of Life looked beautiful.  The song was gorgeous and the ... graphics... the imagery was breathtaking. It was note by note exactly like the animated one- but- ok. Cool. And then, BOOM The Lion King stamps onto the screen- but like what seemed like a second and a half too quickly. And it was from that moment on did the ants from the branches the de-focus onto the zebras below start to crawl up my legs and onto my body as I watched the rest of of this retched movie. 
The timing was all off, the emotion want there. Not even the actors who played the parts in a booth sounded like they wanted to be there. There was NO energy to this at all. And it wasn't just that the animals didn't emote. Everyone (except Simba as a cub, he had some energy) was just so flat. 
Don't get me started on Be Prepared. I just won't even talk about how terrible that was. 
I love almost all movies. Just ask any of my friends or family. They never take my advice on movies because I always find something I like about a movie and sell it on that. I can't with this. 
Ok, The Lion King is a cherished movie of mine, the animated one from what... 1994? I'm aging myself but as a kid I loved this movie. The animation, the songs the heart. Realizing what it is to live because there is a finality to it all.  And what goes around comes around. And Hakuna Matata and be responsible. Be prepared. So many things of who I am today come from being a cute little kid and soaking it all up. Why try to change that? 
Disney did. No need. 
Hey, I really liked the new Disney The Jungle Book that Jon did. But this was just awful.  
I nearly walked out.

I can't wait until the DVD comes out to have it in my collection.  I have seen the new remake Lion King 2x...once 3D and once that was not 3D...I enjoyed both but prefer 3D,2019-07-26T03:47:41.484Z,1.0
6852,978171744,Kimba P,This was horrifically underwhelming. The animation though impressive at time under no circumstances should be used for this type of movie. The lion king is known as a very emotional movie and realism where it is almost impossible to show expression due to that the lion king was a terrible choice to use realism in. Due to the extreme realism these characters can not show emotion at all and it makes it almost impossible to sympathize with any of the characters. Along with that with this style the voice acting just seems off especially for Zazu it doesn't feel like the natural voice many of these characters would have due to their realism in almost every single way except their voices. Every scene is basically the same from the original along with many of the lines. It would make sense to of course keep the main iconic lines but they keep many of the ordinary lines the same as well. In conclusion if you want to see the lion king and relive your childhood do yourself a big favor and watch the original it will be cheaper and better.   ,2019-07-26T03:46:02.243Z,0.0

6874,977294757,Zach B,"Boring. 

A few years ago Disney rereleased the original Lion King in theaters. I remember going with my wife and taking my two young kids. We loved it, just as much as when we were kids. Our kids loved it. The original animation film was and is brilliant!

We have liked nearly all of the live-action adaptations, so we were looking forward to this one greatly. As visually stunning as it was, I was bored to tears, my son was bored to tears, and my sister even fell to sleep. 

I get it, they were trying to make it as realistic as possible. But let's be serious for a second, lions don't talk... You have to draw the line somewhere between reality and entertainment. I just feel they drew the line WAY too far on the realistic side. I would have been far more entertained if they went ultra realistic and presented it as a nature show in Africa, sans voices of course. Or, perhaps I could have saved the money and simply rewatched the original. ",2019-07-26T03:20:29.684Z,0.0

I particularly enjoyed Chiwetel Umeadi in the role of Scar (no small feat to follow Jeremy Irons' performance from the ‚Äò94 original).  A perfectly respectable remake just not one that we needed.

When I‚Äôm checking my watch repeatedly to see about how much time is left before it‚Äôs over then I have to put this in the category of ‚Äònot great‚Äô movies. If I had to put my finger on the element that ruined it for me it would have to be that there was nothing new and fresh about this version other than the cool lifelike animation. There were no new characters introduced, no new songs, nothing to make me want to watch the next scene. Of course I love classics and believe they shouldn‚Äôt be changed, but when you‚Äôre putting this much effort into a reanimation, do some reimagining. Throw in one new character that we absolutely love or a new catchy song that we leave the theatre humming - SOMETHING! I‚Äôm so bummed about it too as I had really been looking forward to this one.

Rafiki's lack of presence in the story and on screen was disappointing.  Scar, I felt, was the best part of the film.

I had to fight, to not jump out of my seat and bellow out the lines from all the songs. I did however dance in my seat and mouthed the words much to the delight of the people around me (my wife thought it was cute, my 16 year old daughter not so much). It had a darker tone than the original. The lion on lion. and lion on hyena fights were a true highlight. The stunt lions were top notch and truly professional. Bring tissue. Lots of tissue. If you think you've processed the tragedies of 1997 version you have not. I cried so hard that I made that ugh ugh ugh sound in my chest.

Youll appreciate it visually and youll be entertained but with a couple of iconic songs missing (or weirdly remixed/touched on, e.g. Be Prepared) youll probably have a better experiencing investing your time as money in the 1994 version.

Beyonc√© as for the acting yes she did do a great job but her singing voice was overpowering Danny‚Äôs voice in ‚ÄúCan you feel the love‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt enjoy the song as much as I hoped.

The intro song wasn‚Äôt as good as how the original played it. Didn‚Äôt care for Nala and felt like Beyonc√© kinda overshadowed Donald Glover in ‚ÄúCan you feel the love tonight‚Äù the song is meant to be harmonized and each actors voice matches the other. Beyonc√© basically just sang over Donald and it was distracting from the visuals. Also Nala as the leader of the lionesses wasn‚Äôt in the original story and obviously that was because of Bey (üòÇüòÇ) also you couldn‚Äôt tell the difference between her and simbas mother.

7280,897821541,Kendra D,"I loved it! I honestly went into the theater, determined to hate it. The Lion King is my all-time favorite Disney movie, maybe even favorite movie, period. So I didn't think they could possibly live up to the original. However, I appreciated that it was basically a shot-for-shot remake, but with a bit of extra material to give us something new. Is it as good as the original animated movie? Of course not. You can't expect a live action film to have that same magic, but it was wonderfully made. All the people complaining about the animals facial expressions sound ridiculous. If the animals had been given more emotional facial expressions on such realistic looking faces it would have been a level of absurdity on par with awful movies such as The Country Bears....and NO ONE should want that! My biggest worry was Be Prepared. Again, the original song is much more entertaining, but I concede that the new version works better with the overall atmosphere of the remake. I'm not sure why critics have been so hard on this movie, other than critics are generally miserable human beings who only seem to like boring, political movies that usually make viewers want to put themselves out of their misery. Don't listen to them. Go see it and make up your own mind! I cried as I watched the beautifully shot opening scene and at the end of the movie, the entire(very full) audience applauded. That should tell you something! I'm fairly certain I was the biggest kid in the theater. My seven year old self came out for a couple hours as I was transported back to my childhood.

7302,959180867,Travis C,"Occasional eye candy achievements don't distract enough from a limp imitation of the former film's strong storytelling. Their faux-realism (or just poor directing and editing) constrain the characters, emotion and plot as they surprisingly abridge useful moments or extend meaningless (and self-indulgent) tangents. For the first time in a long time I felt literal dead air in professional cinema. With new lines like, ""Lions, attack!"", ""I will always fight a bully!"" and a slew of self-aware, soft improv humor that literally steps on itself the film fails to be either Planet Earth or an animated favorite but something caught in-between. Don't listen to people who call it 'Darker' or, god-forbid, 'MORE Shakespearean.' The sense of peril (darkness) is missing almost everywhere (the sensitive lack of nearly eating mice, crushing bugs, elephant skulls or seeing even a drop of blood in this photo-real setting stands out) and Jeremy Irons's original performance as Scar WAS about as Shakespearean and masterfully theatrical as film performances come! They mean to say, the story is lacking but they still want to respect it, like Shakespeare. It's always dangerous to do a cover of even a song, unless you are spot on in imitation - or it's presented in SUCH an original light that the old product takes on new meaning...a la: Broadway's The Lion King! Disney already successfully adapted, probably improved, this very same IP and yet even the gems from that version ('He Lives in You' or female Rafiki's role as storyteller) were void. Nothing sums up the overall film more than its use of Beyonc√©'s new pop-song that was slapped over Simba's formerly iconic return to crestfallen Pride Rock: while the sound of her voice is breathtaking as it flexes it's skill, it does hardly more than repeat the words, 'Spirit' and 'Yeah' without context, and in doing so robs a story-driven (and beloved) score from the former film. CGI wizardry does a good job to deliver little more than the ""Spirit!"" and ""Yeah!"" of a masterpiece that didn't need fixing. ",2019-07-25T14:36:08.158Z,0.0

7312,978171019,James P,"I saw this movie. IT was ok. but it didnt blow we away. I expected graphics to be good because it is disney but disney out smarted themselves. The graphics were so good it watered down the story. When the lions talked it seemed like they were mumbling, Disney made a movie 15 years ago called Narnia the lion the witch and the wardrobe that had a better talking lion in it than this one. The other way they out smarted themselves is they made the lions so good that they couldnt do the night scene for can you feel the love tonight. They could have easily made it live action but enhanced the colors better so they could do that scene properly. Another night scene they had issues with was scar and simba fight. because there isnt a distinction, other than a scar, between the 2 lions its hard to figure out which is which. Last 3 things. Be prepared is one of the great songs in Disneys history and probably the great by a Disney Villian and they practically cut it out. In the original Jeremy iron through out his voice. And some of the Voices just didnt match the characters. Beyonce was great but she really over powered Donald Glover during there song. Maybe thats what they wanted.  It wasnt all doom and gloom I thought Zazu, Timon, and Pumba were very well done and extremely funny. To me they made the movie.

As to the rest: 

There were dialog changes that stole certain lessons away that truly mattered in the original without adding anything at all (making the choice to change them incomprehensible), the voice acting from most everyone involved (including James Earl Jones somehow) seemed rushed and uninspired, certain adjustments made to songs ruined not only the songs, but the scenes surrounding them (see: Be Prepared done as essentially a slam poetry session and Can You Feel the Love Tonight inexplicably taking place in broad daylight... WHAT?) and, making matters worse, they extended In the Jungle The Mighty Jungle & added in a new song by Beyonce (terrible) that took up run time that could have just gone toward properly doing the original songs. Also, in most all of the songs, the singing was done as if they were auditioning for America's Next Big Pop Star, the purity of the songs being replaced by ear grating over singing. 

If you're a hugh Lion King fan, you'll find plenty of moments of nostalgia to fall into that tug on your heart strings, but Be Prepared to be torn right back out of the moment over and over again.",2019-07-25T14:22:57.876Z,0.0

But this remake lacked something, the voice acting felt rushed especially from young Simba and Donald Glover as adult Simba. My favourite character from the lion king is Scar and be prepared is one of my favourite songs in this remake the song was spoken and not sang, while I have no issues with Chiwetel Ejiofors acting he didn't feel like Scar. Bringing back the legend that is James Earl Jones as Mufasa was an amazing decision, this could have been followed by bringing some others back such as Rowan Atkinson as Zasu and Jeramy Ions as Scar.

7379,827144356,Jelani W,"Was a ""live action"" version of The Lion King necessary? No. Did it live up to the original? No. Was it a bad film? Not at all. The Lion King remake was fine; I think critics are being way too harsh on it. The visuals were done really well...most of the voice casting was on point; the only 2 that didn't work for me was, sadly James Earl Jones; you can tell he's getting older because he didn't have the energy that he did in the original. The other one was Beyonc√©. I'm a huge fan of her as a singer and ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" and ""Spirit"" were great but her voice acting didn't work for me. The stand outs were Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen as Timon and Pumbaa, respectively. They had me cracking up from the moment they came on screen and I actually liked their version of ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"" better than on the original film. The only thing that really bothered me in the film was the new version of ""Be Prepared."" I didn't like it at all. At the end of the day, if you're looking for the magic that was captured in the original, you'll be severely disappointed; if you're looking for a good time at the movies, you'll have just that and I believe that's why, despite the harsh reviews, it's still making money because people are having a good time watching it.

Don't listen to these movie trolls who clearly hibernate in a dark room in their parents basement. This is a must see movie! Absolutely spectacular! ,2019-07-25T11:54:59.310Z,1.0
7455,978170873,Marta W,"I thnk this version is much more mature than the orginal. Kids can enjoy both (especially with new one having some great humor delivered by Timon, Pumba and Zazu), but adults would like this one better. Also I'm a little bit sad, because new version didn't really ""hit me"" where it supposed to (even the very frst scene wasn't so emotional and ""wow"" for me and we're not talking about ""Be prepared"").
But despite all of that, I really enjoyed it. I don't know how I can explain how much I'm proud of world and people and technology for being able to make films like The Lion King. That's so unbelievable; everything in this movie look so realistic, I can't believe it.
To summarize my review, as a stand-alone movie - it's really great. Although as a Lion King franchise, it lacks some elements.

I was so disappointed because it fell so short of my expectations and angry that I wasted my  not only on the admission price but I chose to go to a theater that serves food in the theater to really make it a special event. The tickets-and of course food prices-were very expensive but considering circumstances I felt it was worth it. It was visually dark and scary. Violent scenes were prolonged and unnecessarily detailed. Even the middle ""hakuna matata"" scenes were not enough to lighten this movie. Not child friendly.

I wanted this movie to be amazing and that's probably why it fell a little short for me. The cast were brilliant except for Beyonce. It may garner some hate but I thought her voice acting was bad, like really bad. It takes nothing away from her singing which was phenomenal but her voice acting took me out of the movie. I think the most important thing though was I wanted to want to cry during that one scene (don't make me say it) and it did... Oh boy did it so it gets my nod of approval...

However, given how many of us already know this story so well, I was really surprised to see Disney play it so safe. With quite literally no new scenes or characters or anything to make it stand out from the original, this reminds me of that ill-fated shot-for-shot remake of Psycho. Although the voice acting was generally great, particularly Pumba, Timon, and Zazu, and it is gorgeous to look, I found myself nodding off right around the time the climactic confrontation was happening, during a first date with a girl I've been wanting to see for months, which is a very good indicator of how involved I was in the film. There were a lot more fart jokes than in the original and the only new sequence I noticed involved a beetle rolling around some giraffe poop with a tuft of simba's hair in it (it was actually way better than it sounds and a more visceral representation of the circle of life). While it remains a classic story for the most part, it does not manage to outshine the original and is basically pointless.",2019-07-25T07:20:36.918Z,0.0

I was surprised that they even had a screenwriter since at least 80% was word for word the same to the animated movie. It didn't add anything new, exciting, or something meaniningful to the plot like previous live-action films have, or at least tried to, and the emotions of the characters didn't make me feel much of anything. I will give major props to Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen who were great in their roles. And, of course, the legend himself James Earl Jones.

7607,880942050,Daniel A,"The Lion King looks amazing, the CGI looks so good that one would think they're  watching a National Geographic documentary. All the realistic animal mannerisms are perfectly done. The action sequences and fights might even upset small children since they look so real. The score by Hans Zimmer is great, as is most of the songs in this re-make of the iconic classic. The opening felt just as epic as the original as well. 

All this familiarity leads to one of many issues with this film. It is literally 95% a copy of the original with little original input  (unlike Aladdin and Beauty & the Beast). It was surprising since I've been told John Favreau (Iron Man 1 & 2) did a great job with the Jungle Book.  Sometimes I found myself bored unless Scar or Timon and Pumbaa were on screen. Let me give props to Chiwetel Eijifor (12 Years a Slave, Doctor Strange) for his take on the iconic villain Scar, he made a believer out of me and you could feel all the jealous and scornful emotion in his voice acting. 

Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (Seth Rogen) stole the show here as their voice actors did a great job. John Oliver as Zazu was okay as his voice was sometimes jumping in and out of Rowan Atkinson's (Mr. Bean) version from the original movie.  Keegan Michael Key, Eric Andre, and Florence Kasumba did a decent job as the Hyenas enough that I didn't miss Whoopi Goldberg and her crew from the original. JD Mc Crary did a nice job capturing the young Simba and of course it helps that youngster's singing talent is high. 

Now for the huge let down of this movie, Donald Glover aka Childish Gambino, did a horrible job voice acting adult Simba. I'm a fan of his so I don't know what happened, his performance is mostly monotone with barely any emotion. His failure could not be saved by Beyonce who although very talented musically, is just an okay voice actress as adult Nala. She too fell to the ""I'm just reading a script in a studio"" trope, but still found some good moments, further making Donald Glover look bad. 

Perhaps it was a bad idea to give the Scar character such a good actor and give Simba/Nala music artists? Perhaps this is just an example of the supporting cast being better than the male lead? I read some audiences didn't like the lack of emotion from the animals but I understand why Disney did it. They wanted realistic ""animal instinct and emotion"". 

FINAL REVIEW: 6 out of 10. The weakest entry in the live action Disney remakes, and I can't believe I'm saying this, but it's because of Donald Glover's uninspired performance.

7624,917823122,Kyle C,"I went into this movie thinking that ""The Lion King"" was going to be just another pointless remake for the big bucks at Disney. But what I ended up discovering was a live-action remake that, although at times, fall flat against the original, does pay homage and love to the animation. 

You can tell that Jon Favreau and the cast was excited to work on this film through all of the press releases and interviews. And although the film doesn't take a huge amount of creative risk (with the exception of Tumon and Pumba having some improv lines), I'd rather have this version of the film than the ""Beauty and the Beast"" remake, which dumbs down the film for a modern audience. 

I do wish that the movie did take some risk and add new material (there was a rumor going on for a while that ""He Lives In You"" was going to add to this film that I so wish was true). And I do wish that Favreau did take some creative risks when making this film, but I understand the hesitancy in doing so. ",2019-07-25T04:57:41.180Z,1.0

7632,975392564,Krystal T,"Just because a film company has the ability to do something doesn't necessarily mean they should. 

There were so many scenes that were just so out of place and transitions that took so long to finish. It felt like their animation department got bored waiting for the next instruction so they started to mess around, then added their bumblings as movie filler. The scene where Rafiki discovers Simba is alive was never ending, not to mention it felt like it was stolen straight from the ""Polar Express"".

And no good one star review would be complete without a review of the characters. In the original ""Lion King"" Timon and Pumba were the plucky comic reliefs. Sure they were lazy, but their quirky quips and deep friendship and their parent-like affection for Simba was what made them likeable. In this movie they're @$$holes! Everytime they were on screen I couldn't wait for them to leave. Everything from their tone of voices to their dialogue was nihilistic. I understand their characters are lazy and carefree, but they go as far as making fun if the circle of life saying and I quote ""life is meaningless"". And it affects their relationship with Adult Simba (who when you first see as an adult acts like he's had a bit too much ""cat-nip"" if you know what I mean). Because the only scenes Timon, Pumba and Simba are in together set them both up as Simba's bullies (which is ironic due to Pumba's quote at the end of the movie) they seem more like   like the room-mates you can't wait to move out then a family unit.

With the negative comes the positive. The animations is flawless. Disney has perfected their textures and computer animation and you can tell a ton of research went into the making of this movie and how these animals would act in nature. You really couldn't tell CGI from actual footage unless you knew what to look for. While the scripts they were given weren't the best the actors/actresses did a comendable job in their roles
I would save your money and wait until it shows up on Netflix like all the other poorly made ""live-action"" movies.

Here are my thoughts: Timon was the best part of the movie the cinematography/visuals were STUNNING hearing the most iconic songs in specific scenes from the og soundtrack/movie was lovely it stayed rather close to the og movie which I didn‚Äôt mind the voiceover performances fell pretty short (imo) except for Timon‚Äôs and Mufasa‚Äôs and made it hard to stay invested in the movie Timon and Pumba had some of the most hilarious lines the vocals from the songs also fell short compared to the vocals of the og movie‚Äîthey literally just weren‚Äôt as strong in singing the melody. The biggest grievance I have with the film is that while the concept of a live action movie with talking animals is not weird to me, the animal faces were virtually expressionless and made it seem like it was just a dubbed over movie.",2019-07-25T04:49:28.176Z,0.0

However, i am not sure if my memory is adding things that never happened in the original that i feel was missing or if it really was a few things missing. Also i feel like a couple of the songs were changed a tad bit. And one was added. But nothing major. Some of the reviews that i saw on youtube were way out of line and i think they didnt know the original at all so they gave it a bad review. Most people are upset about beyonce but i didnt see anything wrong with her part, and i promise im not saying that because im a fan.

The very first song was lacking the emotion that it's supposed to. Then came the worse parts. Especially how they ruined Scar's solo song. The father/son speech. Mufasa says I need to teach my son a lesson and then there was no lesson. He wasn't even upset. It was so rushed and the Mufasa's iconic death was horribly done.

Beyonc√© was a horrible voice over though and should never be casted in a movie ever again. Probably the worst part of the movie was her voice and the hyenas horrible remake aspect.

7798,978170511,David C,"An absolutely visually stunning movie. Watching this movie really makes you realize how far we've come technologically. However, the realness of the movie came at the sacrifice of the soul and personality of the movie that could not come close to the original animated movie. The juxtaposition of the almost expressionless CGI animals and the jokes and songs did not work for me. The voice acting was hit or miss. Donald Glover had his moments where he really shined, but also many where I felt like he was phoning it in. Seth Rogan and Billy Eichner carried the movie from the second act onward as Timon and Pumbaa. Beyonce was the biggest disappointment as Nala unfortunately. Not only is her voice too recognizable, therefore ruining the immersion at points, but her lack of experience as an actress showed and she was only given one line at a time to speak, often breaking the natural flow of conversation. It is a good movie to take the kids to, but if you are looking for some Lion King nostalgia in your life, you'd be better off dusting off the VCR and watching the original.",2019-07-25T03:07:02.127Z,0.0

I‚Äôm not even talking about how the Lions or landscape looked either. Those things did not bother me. Most of the dialogue felt choppy and forced. Scar was not sarcastic or witty like the scar that Jeremy Irons gave us. Speaking of Scar, they basically took away his Be Prepared song and replaced it with...I don‚Äôt even know how to describe it. It was a speech with a little hint of music. Timon and Pumba had some good moments but they weren‚Äôt the Timon and Pumba that I grew to love. I didn‚Äôt even really buy their attachment to Simba like I did in the original. That being said, they did have some funny moments that I enjoyed but it just wasn‚Äôt even a sliver of what I hoped for. There were so many great moments with Rafiki and Simba that we‚Äôre taken out completely. I will say this, Zazu was awesome. John Oliver did an amazing job as Zazu and the lines written for him were great. So basically that‚Äôs it. I loved Zazu but was disappointed by the rest. The End. ",2019-07-25T02:19:53.725Z,0.0

I knew the movie was not going to compliment the original due to its casting. If it wasnt for zazu, timon and pumba it wouldn't be worth watching at all.

8038,977939403,Oscar A,"This is an update that follows very closely to the original with some little tweaks, it heralds a nice, enjoyable watch but doesn't fully work in the end. Obviously the original is a classic and the factors brought in from the old animation make for a great story with valuable morals. There is something strange about photo-realistic CGI animals singing, dancing and trying to show emotion. The films main problem is the animals lack of emotion shown. It just takes you out of it a bit and doesn't allow you to connect like the hand drawn animation does. The ""Long live the king"" line feels absolutely killer in the original but lacks oomph in this remake which is also telling as it's the turning point of the film. The voice cast does a terrific job on the other hand and it looks absolutely amazing, this isn't essential but it's a nice, diverting movie.",2019-07-24T22:11:35.778Z,0.0

the whole cinema was quiet and occasional yawns were heard here and there.. the only time it started to elicit massive reactions from the audience was when pumbaa said, ""you thought he's dead!? i thought i'm dead"", which happened an hour (or even more) after the movie screening started..",2019-07-24T22:07:45.249Z,0.0

8042,978169169,Muhammad S,"This live-action rendition of The Lion King masterfully weaves emotion and fantasy into reality, with great voice acting and vocals. Despite this, the movie demonstrates reality and fantasy have a trade-off. Often, the emotion of the voice and scene do not match that of the face. This leaves the audience feeling emotions but not seeing them. Ultimately, despite the excellent visuals and vocals, the commitment to realism severely detracts from the emotion and fantasy of the original. This continues to be a trend among live-action renditions but given that the characters in the classic are animals the audience is left feeling even more disconnected. ",2019-07-24T22:03:39.344Z,0.0

I was 8 years old when I saw this amazing animated wonder that blew our minds with the technology of that age. I am blessed to have shared this experience in 3D with my own daughter, age 5. She's seen the animated classic, and was so excited to see this movie with the technology of our current times! She didn't know it would be in 3D, so that was a fun experience as well. This was very well done, and with the right 3D touches. As for the movie, it stayed true to the original, with adding just enough to make it so valuable for it's own take on the story. The humor from Zazu, Timon, and Pumba was so much of a tribute, while adding some new character input that I completely loved. I think my favorite part of the whole movie is probably the ""In the Jungle"" song. There were so many great parts though! Kudos to the Simba/Scar fight scene. Disney has come such a long way in CGI and animation. The recent live-action, CGI adaptions have been incredible, however each story line between Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, have had some story line changes to adapt to the live actor casting.

8082,90B507AA-42C7-47A8-BC24-49A643E16597,ryan d,"The Lion King is undoubtedly one of the most popular movies of all time. For any kid, this movie has been beloved for many years and seen many many times. Disney has been taking their classic cartoons such as The Jungle Book and Aladdin and making them into ‚Äúlive action‚Äù adaptions. Of course with it looking ‚Äúlive action‚Äù, doesn‚Äôt mean that it truly is ‚Äúlive action‚Äù. In fact from what I‚Äôve read, nothing is real and it‚Äôs all computer animated making it an extremely over the top animated movie. The movie looks terrific. It‚Äôs really amazing how far technology has come. Truthfully the movie is really good. All it is is a movie that you all know that now looks like real animals in a real location that you‚Äôve seen in once before as a cartoon. None of the voices stood other than James Earl Jones as Mufasa (who played the role in the cartoon) and Seth Rogen as Pumba and Billy Eichner as Timon. Seth Rogen definitely stood out obviously because of his unique voice. If you loved the original cartoon and you‚Äôve always wondered how it would be if it looked real, well here‚Äôs your chance. The movie couldn‚Äôt have been better and couldn‚Äôt have been worse. It was perfect as it was doing what the cartoon did, just updated. It‚Äôs certainly nothing new or special, but it‚Äôs a nice walk down memory lane for people who grew up with the original cartoon such as myself.",2019-07-24T20:43:21.973Z,1.0

The use of JEJ's voice brought back childhood memories, and Hans Zimmer's tracks were as always, beautiful. Donald Glover and Beyonce made some fantastic performances too, though the younger Simba could have been a little less plucky.

8135,978095449,Chelsea D,"Sooooo disappointing!! I should have know due to all the hype that this movie was gonna be crap and politically motivated. 
Problem # 1 :
Because they wanted the ""Lion"" Characters to be African American, they didn't have the original voice of Scare! His voice and Mufasa's voice are the 2 most iconic voices!! So to know they did that was just so sad...if white people did that it would be F*$%#@ up too! I mean who does that! They ruined something so iconic and special due to politics... 

Problem# 2 :
Since this movie was a ""live action"", the emotion was lost! I felt confused the whole time. I was looking at ""real"" animals, yet they sound like cartoon characters...Weird! 

I think that if they wanted to do something truly different and special, they should have done the ""live action"" but with no voices! Almost like watching a BBC animal documentary! That would have been so creative and different!! 

But no...Just straight up a disappointment! The whole time I just wanted to be watching the original Lion King! I was thinking the whole time...why am I putting myself thought this misery of watching this, when I can watch the real one at home!

Save you time and your money! I give them a A for effort I guess, but an F+++ in creativity! They literally sucked out everything that makes the Lion King special!         ",2019-07-24T18:58:52.774Z,0.0

I hardly cried when Mufasa died because it lacked so much emotion that the original has. I'm so disappointed I think I'm done giving Disney's live action movies any more chances. Found a couple of plot holes that didn't make any sense. For example, *Spoiler*, Zazu was present when Scar was at the gorge when he said to Zazu "" go on, I'll help save them"".

I liked the added twist from other Disney movies and how they added a scene from the original. Although the hola dance scene was one of my  all time favorite scenes I liked how they supplemented it. I gave it 4 starts because you cant replace the original. And with animation the imagination is a lot more enjoyable. You know a live animal cant really hola, but with the animated original the possibilities of what they can do are impossible. 
One thing I did finally realize thanks to live action:. Scar and the hyenas did not drive away the herds. It was the drought. If the herds ran away then the vegetation would of been prospered and gotten out of control. Then the monsoon season came coincidentally when simba arrived.",2019-07-24T17:43:49.266Z,1.0

Billy and Seth were a funny duo. Whoopie and James Earl Jones are great of course. Everything else just fell short for me. The actors didnt quite make the characters their own.

8241,900619245,Nate Z,"Ever since the run-up of Disney's live-action remakes, I've been predicting what would happen with the newer films, and it all seems to be coming true. The problem with Disney remaking hit animated movies from the 80s and 90s is that there hasn't been enough distance. The immediate audience is going to demand their nostalgia exactly as they remember it, and they will not be happy with anything less. It's not like a scenario where the original movies could be improved upon, like 2016's beautifully tender Pete's Dragon. What these live-action remakes offer is an uglier, inferior version of an animated classic. There's no reason for most of them to exist. They won't be different; they won't be interesting. It's a sludgy, auto-tuned cash grab that shows no end in sight. Before this year, I did not expect Tim Burton's Dumbo to be the best of the three 2019 Disney live-action remakes, but here we are. I guess the concept of Disney eating its own tail with these live-action remakes is symbolic of the studio ""circle of life,"" and the perfect segue way to The Lion King, a remake missing the wonder and magic of the 1994 original.

King Mufasa (voiced by James Earl Jones again) rules over an African prairie and preparing his young son Simba (JD Mcrary and Donald Glover as an adult) for his eventual rule. Mufasa's scornful brother Scar (Chiwetel Ejiofor) conspires to have Mufasa killed and Simba banished. Blaming himself for his father's death, Simba runs away and finds kinship with a meerkat named Timon (Billy Eichner) and a warthog named Pumba (Seth Rogen). They preach a carefree life of ""no worries."" This new life is interrupted when Nala (Beyonc√© Knowles), Simba's childhood friend, returns seeking help to remove Scar from the throne. Simba must confront his fate and treacherous uncle and bring balance back to his ailing homeland.

The biggest appeal of director Jon Favreau's Lion King remake is the stunning special effects. It's been ten years since James Cameron brought to life a photo realistic alien world that dazzled audiences, and the advances have only made the professional fakery more startling. This movie was completely ""filmed"" inside a computer. Every single shot, every blade of grass, every pebble, every photo realistic morsel onscreen is the result of digital wizards. In 2016's The Jungle Book, there were still some physical elements filmed, chief among them the human boy, but now it's all done away. The remake looks like an HD nature documentary. One could question the use of the technology, $250 million to recreate what ordinary cameras on location could achieve, but I'll choose to congratulate Disney and Favreau on the remarkable technical achievement. The Jungle Book was a big leap forward and The Lion King is that next step. However, the special effects are ultimately the only selling point. Come see how real it all looks, kids. The rest of the remake left me feeling unmoved and occasionally perplexed.

This is an almost exact shot-for-shot recreation of the original movie. It made me think of Gus van Sant's 1998 Psycho remake and why anyone would go to this much trouble to make a copy. You'll feel a tingle of recognition with different shots and scenes and then that feeling will transition to disappointment and lastly resignation. It's the same, just not as good.

So what exactly is different with the live-action Lion King of 2019? Very very little. Despite totaling a half hour more movie, it really only has one added incidental Beyonc√© song, a small character beat where Timon and Pumba explain their philosophy on more fatalistic terms, an explanation how Nala left the pride lands, and more poop and fart jokes. The filmmakers have added realism in appearance but also added more scatological humor, which seems like an odd combination. There is a literal plot point attached to giraffe poop. Instead of a whispery feather, petal, whatever finding its way to the baboon Rafiki to let him know Simba is still alive, now we watch the life of a tuft of fur as it travels from creature to creature, at one point being consumed on a leaf by a giraffe. The next image is a ball of poop being rolled by a beetle with our tell-tale tuft of lion fur. I guess it's more emblematic of the whole ""circle of life"" theme, but I didn't think Disney was going to literalize the poop aspect. The new Beyonc√© song is fairly bland and unmemorable. That's it, dear reader. Lion King 2019 is 95 percent identical to Lion King 1994 in plot, and yet the original writers do not earn a screenwriting credit thanks to arcane animation writing guild rules, and that is madness. It's their story, it's their characters, and it's almost entirely their dialogue, and to not have their names rightfully credited where they belong is wrong.

There are some definite drawbacks to that photo realism as well. When lions and other animals are photo realistic, they have facial structures that don't exactly emote, so it looks like all the animals often just have their jaws wired shut. You'll listen to the vocal actors go through a range of emotions and watch these plain, unmoved faces that you start to wonder if maybe all of the dialogue should have just been voice over. As soon as I saw Mufasa speaking, I was immediately shaken by the image and longed for the expression of the animation. I never got over it and it made me feel removed from the film, even more so. This is the trade off of realism; animals don't actually speak, you know. Another trade off is that the film becomes much more intense especially for younger kids. I would not recommend parents take the littlelest ones to this movie because now, instead of watching a traditionally animated band of characters brawl, you're watching realistic lions and hyenas scrape, claw, and hurl one another to their deaths. If kids were traumatized by parts of the original movie, I can only imagine the nightmares that await. Strangely, the photo realism also mitigates the film's sense of scope and impact. The stampede sequence feels far less dangerous because the camera doesn't pull back that far, showing a massive herd from a distance. Subsequently the sequence loses some of its urgency. Then there's also simply identifying who may be who when those fights come, because you're trying to pick out realistic animals instead of distinct creatures with specific character designs.

The aspects you enjoyed with the 1994 Lion King will still be enjoyable, even if they suffer in direct comparison. Hans Zimmer's score is still magnificent. The songs are still catchy, though some of the arrangements are a bit under-cooked, like the speak-sung ""Be Prepared."" The song ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"" occurs absurdly early in the Simbla/Nala reunion and takes place in the sunny afternoon. So much for ""tonight"" (the famous Nala ""bedroom eyes"" moment is also quite diminished from a real lion's face). The jokes are still funny because they were funny the first time. The things that worked the first time will still work to some degree, even if the presentation leaves something to desire. Several of the vocal artists just sound flat, especially Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave) who comes across so blas√©. I missed the casual menace of Jeremy Irons. The best vocal performances belong to Eichner (Difficult People) and Rogen (Long Shot), maybe because they're already broad personalities, or maybe because they felt the most comfortable to occasionally steer away from the original script, finding small room to roam. Florence Kasumba (Black Panther) also delivers a snarling and effective performance as one of the hyena leaders, Shenzi. They're the only vocal performances that fare well in competition.

I need to defend the art of animated films. There is nothing wrong with animated films simply because they are animated. A live-action version is not better simply because it's more ""real."" I hear this same argument when it comes to making a live-action anime. Animation is a wonderful medium and has a magic all its own that often live-action cannot emulate. The animated Lion King is beautiful with bold colors, strong visual compositions, and emotive characters with specific designs. The live-action Lion King is missing much of that, at least when it's not recreating exact shots from its predecessor. I don't know who this movie is going to appeal to. Parents will be better off just playing the original for their children at home. Die-hard fans of The Lion King might enjoy seeing their favorite story told with plenty of cutting-edge special effects magic. I would have been happier had the filmmakers attempted something like Julie Taymor's transformative and ground-breaking Broadway show. I would have been happier had they just recorded the Broadway show. The new Lion King is a lesser version of the 1994 movie, plain and simple, and if that's enough for you, then have at it. For me, these Disney live-action remakes are making me feel as dead in the eyes as a photo realistic lion.

The animation is hyper realistic and loos fantastic, the downside is realistic animals dont have human emotions and expressions like the original animation style. So it took a few minutes to get used to the disconnect between the lack of human facial expressions and the expressive voice acting. What I loved was that they kept soo many shot for shot scenes and frames from the original, it was like a treasure hunt with each scene. The humor is awesome and up to date without over doing it or being cheesy Seth and Billy are a fantastic Timons and Pumba. In fact all the voice acting is amazing, Beyonc is lack luster, shes just not an actor and it shows. Her duet with Glover in The Love Tonight didnt sound right to me, she just over powers Glover the whole way through, and Donald is an amazing singer. Overall it felt and sounded like Beyonc not Nala from the first she enters the movie, its distracting but not bad. Her stand alone song Spirit was great and she sounds much better solo in that track.

Maybe they should have left it alone, but this is Hollywood and it‚Äôs all about the dollars I‚Äôm afraid. It‚Äôs good, it‚Äôs just not as good as the original, but then again what is?

The first lion king was the greatest animated Disney movie of all time and so the 2019 lion king had a high bar.

8309,978169836,Ashlynn C,"Whilst the visuals are amazing and very realistic I couldn't fully enjoy this movie. It lacked the expressions in the characters due to the animals being too realistic and that really ruins the movie. While I don't want to discredit the hard work that went into this animation, it just doesn't work well for this movie. Especially when the original Lion King was more vibrant and emotional. I was able to feel the Mufasa's betrayal in that movie while in this one, I couldn't even tell Mufasa was shock if it wasn't for the voice acting. And that brings me to my other problem. This movie relies to heavily on the voice actors to show the emotion in the characters yet it just looks odd when the faces of the animals aren't dynamic.  Overall, it's a nice remake with some nice changes but it's not worth seeing when you can't even tell the difference between Simba's sad and happy face.",2019-07-24T14:41:34.871Z,0.0

8334,976042993,Chasha M,"Thanks to technology, we are now in the age where we can animate realistic animals that most of us only get to see in documentaries. That was the Lion King - a documentary where the animals could speak and had a bit of personality. And that was the only great thing about this remake ‚Äì the realistic visuals which are, simply put, quite BRILLIANT.
Aside from the genius photorealistic animation, the Lion King was a miss. Half the time I was waiting to see a National Geographic logo or a ‚Äò'special thanks to Animal Planet'' shout-out just before the credits. The remake had all the personality of a souped-up nature documentary. What made the original Lion King stand out was the emotion, Timon and Pumba's humor, the strength and majesty of Mufasa, and the loyalty of Zazu. The original Lion King was more than just words and voices, it was emotion, timing and delivery. I guess that's too much to ask to make a NatGeo lion emote, but even Bumblebee from Transformers had more emotions. And he was a machine.
I get it, it's a bit difficult to add frowns to realistic buffalo, but they could have made up for it by adding more depth and passion in the voice acting. I know they can do it, they did it with Scar. He may have had the same facial expression when sad, happy, evil, while singing but boy did he play the bad guy like a pro. I cannot say the same for the other characters, especially Mufasa. While I am glad they had the original voice for Mufasa, the voice acting this time around felt like watching David Attenborough play 007. Don't get me started on the most pinnacle scene in the entire movie, the death of Mufasa. My friends and I still talk about how we all cried for weeks after watching that scene, and it still hurts just thinking about him falling. In this movie it felt like it was quickly recorded in the studio and synced with a rushed scene. It was, in a word, disappointing.
If this is the direction live action movies will take, maybe they should stop making them. I don't understand why one would want to make a very realistic movie-documentary, spend a lot of time and effort perfecting the visuals but falling short on the actual characters in the movie. Not only does it butcher the movie but takes away the one thing that made us all love the movie in the first place, EMOTION. For the next one just allow them to move their f** eyebrows, make them speak ‚Äòmore realistic', make the damn monkey do kungfu. If I want to watch a nature documentary, I will turn on Animal Planet, but I want to watch Lion King so please do not ruin our childhood for the sake of realism",2019-07-24T14:17:52.033Z,0.0

8354,977817116,Jacob K,"this has GOT to be the worst disney reboot movie they have made in a LONG time:

1) it's note by note the same movie
2) the cgi is so ugly that my eyes kept fasing in cause all i kept seeing was almost white dirt and pitch blackness
3) i was in a theater watching this and everyone was stuck to the screen, and not in a good way, i thought they all were just copying how emotionless the charecters looked, they all look stoned out of their fucking minds
3) the cgi is SO bad, that even tho i know what was gonna happen in the movie, i got mixed up on which lion was which. Simba, Mufasa and Scar have very lil changes, other then scar's scare. Nala and young simba look IDENTICAL, and the same goes for older nala and sarabi
4) they COMPLETELY cut scenes out of the movie, to make room for (i kid you not i left the theater at this point for a 2 minute break after looking at this) a bit of simba's hair floating with the dust cloud after he flopped on the cliff at night, and that single strand of hair drifted for 3 FUCKING MINUTES, to get eaten by a girafe, shat out, and then a lil dung beatle rolls the lil shit ball up, with the hair still sticking out of it, and going off into the next scene . . . i'm fucking baffled by this
5) the fact that i bring up how bad it is, people just think i'm racist cause ""oh, cause you don't like african cast movies now"" and just wanna fucking make an excuse for liking it cause it's ""new""
6) The songs are all one take'd. Be prepared is litterally scar just saying the lines, no harmony, no syncing with the melody, just him talking and the hyaenas just hum the song

out of 100%, i would give this probably the same rate as food fight and the nutcracker in 3d, and thats like high 10% - to low 5%",2019-07-24T13:46:08.777Z,0.0

8360,978169779,Danil V,"A mere shadow of its original. When the animals are that realistic all emotion, heart and soul are gone, it's time to concider whether this tool of storytelling is fitting for the story - it's hard to put an emotion-driven musical with antropomorphic singing animals in a realistic setting. It had a couple of decent tings going on, but Disney should listen to the owrds of Mufasa and start remembering who they are - people who want to present great stories to children and adults all over the world, or a soulless corporation that cashes in on nostalgia by copying the work of their former artist and slightly change it to make twice the money the original did?

People are genuinely blinded by Beyonc√©. This movie can not compare to the original. The emotion and comedic relief was lost in several memorable scenes throughout the movie due to it being a ""live action "" film. It genuinely messed with the integrity of the film. I felt I was watching the National Geographic with bad narration. The voice actors were trash except for Mufasa and Scar. Simba's faking crying voice was trash made Mufasa death awkward.

8475,978118848,Edgar B,"I don't want to spoil too much but lack of any facial expression it really kills some of the magic of this movie, especially because if we cared so much for those characters in the original movie is because we emphasised with those characters. 
I understand that in order to look more realistic the animals cannot have the same facial expression than humans. But for God's sake, animals don't talk or make jokes or dance either. They could have at least give them a little bit more of expressivity, so when I look at Simba's face after Mufasa's death, I can see sadness. Or when Scar tells Simba that he killed Mufasa, to see in Simba's eyes the surprise and anger. But there's nothing of it because ""it wouldn't be so realistic"".

But if there's something that really bothers me of this movie is too see what they did to my favourite Disney villain, Scar.

I could write an essay about how stupid is to hide fascism and it makes worse for new generations to identify how dangerous is that.
The mythical scene and song of Scar on Be Prepared where he looks like a Lion Hitler is just amazing and, at the same time, it sends a message to the kids telling them that is wrong and is what villains and bad people do.
And what's the motivation for that change they had? Political Correctness? That someone might be offended if there's any representation of real things that happened in this world?

Hiding our history and bad things we did it never ends well. In order to be prepared and identify dangerous behaviours and politics we need to know our history and to no be afraid of talking about it and having representations on movies.

This remake has become the worse remake Disney has done so far. 
And my message for Disney is: next time just make a new and original movie. You have talented screenwriters. You made amazing movies and characters in the past. There's no need for these remakes, is just laziness. I understand you want to make money but you are Disney, we are gonna watch whatever you do. In fact, if you make a new and original movie you are gonna make even more money probably and you are gonna get more fans. But right now your only target is people that grew up on the '80s and '90s and making them go and watch the remakes of their favourite animated movies, and you are pissing them off.",2019-07-24T11:17:59.312Z,0.0

8477,260269802,,"This one honestly saddens me. I really liked the original growing up. But this one is less than a shot for shot remake unfortunately. The first half of the film was excellent, it gave itself enough build up to each scene (while basic in every film), and took the shot for shot formula that it‚Äôs given and really did it perfectly. But once Simba grew up, the film gets so lazy. The movie just kinda flows effortlessly with laziness, things just end up happening that completely lack build up and emotion. This is incredibly noticeable in the climax, about 3 sentences of dialogue for the two characters that oddly enough, feels unnatural, then it just cuts to the battle. The issue is it needed more build up to the scene, give it some more dialogue, emotion, and depth as well as meaning to the climax. It‚Äôs just lacking and this scene is just an example of this, the whole second half of the film is like this. The voice acting is well done, except Donald Glover as Simba just doesn‚Äôt fit Simba and felt like a miscast. His performance isn‚Äôt the issue, he just doesn‚Äôt fit Simba and it feels very odd. Nonetheless, the CGI is absolutely stunning and is worth buying a ticket for in the best screen possible. All together it‚Äôs another unfortunate cash grab by Disney, with absolutely amazing CGI, visuals, and a great first half, but the poor writing, pacing, and lack of general build up in the second half is more than noticeable, which left my group and I unsatisfied. I recommend checking it out for the visuals alone, but the original is much better overall. 4/10",2019-07-24T11:08:44.037Z,0.0

However the humor that made the Animated Film so memorable and the sarcasm from Scar and the quips from the Hyenas was sadly missing. Though disappointing, it did have new humor and it is....enjoyable. A Far cry better than Will Smiths Dismal performance as Genie, and Disneys Latest Attempt at a New Version of Aladdin. Though they have had a few successful runs with the live action adaptations some classics are best left alone.",2019-07-24T05:44:37.904Z,1.0

The baby simba parts at the beginning were cringe at times and throughout the entire movie their are some scenes that are trying to be different from the original but it just makes the movie worse. Going into this I wanted it to be good and thought that maybe it could‚Äôve been like Aladdin with charm and heart but this movie has no heart . It just felt like people doing voice overs for a National Geographic special. Donald Glover as simba is horrible, he showed nothing, no character. Same with Beyonc√©, shes terrible and yes she‚Äôs a good singer but she‚Äôs a terrible actor. The only characters that had heart were Seth rogans warthog , scar, and billy on the streets muskrat.

This movie shouldn't replace the original in anybodies collection but it is more than worthy of sitting side by side as a companion piece.

You have to see it in a theater where the sound is loud enough for you to feel the music, otherwise everything will lack energy. Outside of that though, it felt like what I just described: it lacked energy. The actors seemed like they just came to work and did their part, but unfortunately, the lack of expression in the animals also communicated the same thing. The only good performances were Timon and Pumba‚Äôs characters, Keegan Michael Key (although he felt very much on his own throughout the movie even though he had other hyenas with him), and James Earl Jones. You wanted to feel something from this movie, for it to take you back to the original with it‚Äôs score and story.

The animation was beautiful but the voice acting is a big thumbs down for me. I felt like I could hear a majority of the cast reading from a script. The dialogue sounded forced and unnatural and I found it very distracting. Beyonce's voice was also a turn off to me, pulled me out of the movie. The film also lent very heavily on the nostalgia of the original with most of it being a shot by shot replay from beginning to end. The parts I enjoyed most were the very small added scenes that deferred from the original, giving me more context to the story. Scar was the best part. I found myself truly nervous when he was on screen. More insight into his background would've been an easy way to add more to the original without forcing it and these simple expansions went wrongfully ignored.

That being said I felt that there were a lot of moments that were rushed, especially the dialogue. I think it‚Äôs great that the dialogue was copied word for word in some scenes because the original is written so well but it was rushed and there were not enough pauses for reaction, there was not enough emotion in what was being said. Part of it is not being able to see facial expressions on real animals as opposed to animated characters. The music failed in comparison to the original. However, there were some highlights to the vocals. Billy Eichner as Timon I thought was the best male singer but the worst voice actor. I was underwhelmed with Beyonc√©‚Äôs performance but loved her new song. I did absolutely love the final battle scene. This was done very well from the combat scenes to the special effects and I really did enjoy all the nuances. I like that the movie was made to be relevant to this generation with humor that can be relatable. It‚Äôs not as good as the original Lion King but I did enjoy watching and I would still recommend seeing it especially in theaters.",2019-07-24T03:54:06.618Z,1.0

Comparing the two Lion Kings is inevitable but if this Lion King had come out by itself it would be a game  changer.  The fact that the cartoon original is indeed a classic but that does NOT diminish the new version.  The animators restricted themselves in the facial and mouth expressions to stay closer to reality and for the most part it works.,2019-07-24T03:50:22.675Z,1.0

it's fundamentally the exact same movie we saw 25 years ago, becoming an almost shot-by-shot version of such. It is not better than its predecessor; however, its source material is so excellent that it allows this ""new"" film to, at least, be a very good movie, despite its lack of identity at times. Its formidable visuals and CGI, added to a story that we already love made it enough for me to simply enjoy the movie as a fan.

Amazing CGI but that's about it, they intended to make it look realistic like a documentary, and it does, but why not give the animals expressions? There is nothing realistic about talking animals and without expression it felt flat. Also a lot of annoying minor changes such as Rafiki hits Simba in the head with the staff to teach him a lesson, and this is not in this version...huh? Also no hula song from Timon, and no funny hyenas saying Mufasa's name and making fun of Scar. Please watch the original before you decide to check this out! ",2019-07-24T03:07:30.127Z,0.0

They should have done its own thing since the sequences literally pulled from the animated film felt off and sadly #chiwetelejiofor was horribly miscast as Scar. Since it felt like he wasn't giving any emotions to scar to the extent when he murders Mufasa.. he came off as meh...and Jeremy Irons was asked to return though gave the condition for the producers to respect his character and the film as a whole, though, in the end, he saw something and left the project.

The thing I didnt like was how they over did it on the jokes. it's like they dumped it down for people to get it when it was funny in the cartoon and didnt need to be explained. Hopefully you get my meaning. I understand though cause people dont get things or have common sense the get jokes or sarcasm. I love the cartoon better over all .

8845,869783670,Samantha O,"I think it was an amazing remake of the original. But I can't give it a full 5 star for the following reasons: 
- Nala's voice.. ruined the character. I love Beyonce but that's all I could hear.. Beyonce, not nala. It's literally the same voice we hear when she's doing her interviews.. it was not a good pick and just didn't do it for me
- BE PREPARED! Once of the BEST songs from the 1st one was shortened to less than half its original length and was nowhere close to being as captivating as it should've been.
- Scar was not the same character. His sass, sarcasm and deep deep voice just weren't there at all. He was just an old, ill and evil looking lion.. 
- Shenzi and Ed! Where were they? I know shenzi was there and they probably had their reasons for modifying the character but, the hyenas just weren't anywhere close to being as funny as they were in the original. (AND CMON!! Why no Whoopie?)
- The autotuned voices; it's super annoying. Just keep it real, It's no fun to hear autotuned voices when a child is singing a song - it's supposed to be a child's voice lol not an X factor performance (Can't wait to be king). Little Nala killed it tho! :) 
- Last but not least, the hair ball part was just weird and long lol 

Now for the good stuff! 
- Timon and Pumba! BAM! They were life <3 Loved every moment they showed up on screen. Really kept the essence of their characters. Just lovely. 
- The graphics.. omg.. Just the opening made me cry like a little b**** It was absolutely breathtaking 
- Mufasa.. Just waow.. 
- Hakuna matata - THE BOMB
- Rafiki was pretty dope too :)
- zazoo was not voiced by the same actor from the original but they did a fantastic job. 

So overall, it was pretty good :) But would I go see it again? Meh, maybe; it just makes me wanna watch the original that much more!",2019-07-24T02:00:46.652Z,1.0

8948,960720333,,"‚ÄúThe Lion King (2019)‚Äù Review (5/10) It seems the Circle of Life nowadays is being a grown man watching a Disney reboot of a beloved animated film from childhood. We‚Äôve had three of those this summer alone, and the latest ‚Äì a remake of one of their greatest ‚Äì The Lion King is aggressively mediocre in every department except for the visuals. Jon Favreau's aggressively mediocre retelling lacks heart and nuance. The story remains the same, but if you‚Äôre only interested in gawping at the visual boundaries a film could push The Lion King will blow your mind because there is absolutely no way to tell where the ‚Äòlive action‚Äô ends and the CGI animation begins. Everything, from a blade of grass to the eyeballs and fur of the lions is 100 percent photorealistic. Director Jon Favreau employs the same hyper realism technique he did in the terrific The Jungle Book, but the results here are far less effective. Making this film hyper real looking exposes two vital downsides of the original ‚Äì that it has a simplistic story, and clich√© and cringey. The original was such a classic because it hid those downsides with beautiful, colourful animation, sympathetic, emotionally charged faces on the animals, and an extraordinary soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Elton John to tug at your heartstrings during the emotionally heavy moments. Favreau removes these very elements in the remake, making this a drab looking film bereft of colour, with the animals having no emotional core, and adds atrocious remixes of the classic songs. Things ‚Äòhappen‚Äô in this film ‚Äì but they don‚Äôt carry much weight. Simba‚Äôs journey is supposed to be transformational and heroic, but the transitions are too quick and lack energy. The message is very much there ‚Äì that a man shielded by privilege needs to step out and live with the commoners to gain a better perspective on life, and this remake had a golden opportunity to dig deeper into these themes, but the script by Jeff Nathanson makes no such effort. The final fight isn‚Äôt as exciting and emotional as the original, and the same goes for Mufasa‚Äôs death. Disney has retooled some of its classic stories to make them more progressive and nuanced, but we don‚Äôt see that in this Lion King. The comic relief comes predictably from Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumba (Seth Rogen) but here‚Äôs the thing about this whole cast ‚Äì there‚Äôs no shaking away their personalities which are given a bigger focus that the characters in the story. The film pushes celebrity faces rather than good storytelling. If there‚Äôs any statement this film makes it is that voice actors need to get back into recording booths ‚Äì films like these are not going to make less money by giving experts jobs that utilise their expertise.",2019-07-24T00:33:56.078Z,0.0

8962,978169022,R A,"I want my money and 2 hours of my life back.  This movie was a horrible adaptation. Several iconic moments from the cartoon were completely removed. Seth Rogen did nail Pumbaa pretty well, but some of Pumbaa's best scenes & lines were gone.  One scene with Timon and Pumbaa, they even start to plagiarize another Disney movie, instead of doing what actually happened in the cartoon. So sad.   Even the music was lackluster compared to the original. My wife and I watched the original a myriad of times as her little sister and later, my daughter LOVED the cartoon, and watched it over and over.  With the star studded cast they had, I was expecting so much more from it. That being said, I think Chiwetel Ejiofor's Scar performance was pretty good too.  He definitely captured the character. But his performance and Seth's, were not enough to save this train wreck for my family and I. 

Would love to verify my ticket purchase, but they don't even have an option for Neighborhood Cinema Groups in Coldwater, MI.",2019-07-24T00:24:59.722Z,0.0

Disney played this movie very safe, they hardly changed a thing from the original. My least favorite part of the movie was Scar. They should have recasted Jeremy Irons to play him. Overall the songs were very underwhelming, especially ""Be Prepared"" which was hardly a song and more of Scar talking about his evil plan. However, the movie did look amazing, it was really beautiful to look at. The animals looked really lifelike, they looked like real animals that could talk. This movie would be outstanding on IMAX. The only downside to the realism was the fact that they had no facial emotions/expressions.

9052,911492560,Jan S,"People like to jump on the hate bandwagon fairly quickly. But i believe the critics went overboard with bashing this movie. The Lion King is a live  action remake of the 1994 2d animated disney movie of the same name. That's a fact BUT not the know it all end it all because i can't help but feel that the remake set out to complete a different mission than the original and succeeded with fanfares. John Favreau made me believe that real lions had a shakesperian story happen to them.  An odd thing happened to me while i sat in the cinema . I actually got an emotional reaction to the story and it's lessons. The 2D Animated version , i realised, had been too  outlandish , too colorfull for me to care about the message. It felt too detached. (Plus rewatching the original at one point became a visual dopamine dispencer with lack of any depth to me. )The harsch but real looking visuals helped me to trully comprehend what the message was supposed to be. (Even though they did leave out a bit about learning from your past)It had me close to tears to be honest. Now the movie isn't perfect (but neither was the original) and it still succeeds mostly due to it's visual strength. (Like  the original, just with less emphasis on abstraction and more on realism. ) It's not that deep (granted neither was the original, but we're talking about disney here, so it's no surprise we didn't get ""the end of evangelion"" with lions ....althought that would have been funny.) To end this review on a positive note. Both 2D and 3D Cub Simba and Nala are imensely cute , so  there's that.",2019-07-23T22:50:56.750Z,1.0

While watching ""The Lion King"" (2019), a young couple sat to my left, eagerly anticipating the movie's famous songs, sometimes going so far as to sing the lyrics just before they played. And to my right sat three teenage friends, who occasionally whispered such comments as (and I'm paraphrasing here), ""That's just like the cartoon!""

I've a feeling most people will watch this ""photorealistic, computer-animated"" version of the traditionally animated classic the same way as my fellow audience members, with the ability to recite and recall almost everything about the 1994 original with relative ease, and then take temporarily solace in the fact the remake realizes the story in more or less the same fashion. 

""The Lion King"" is one of those movies that just about everybody has seen. It's the quintessential ""comfort movie,"" with its classical yet still compelling narrative; its vast and colorful imagery; its mostly cheerful and only sometimes tragic tones; and its healthy mix of action, humor and romance. It's no wonder the film was so well received when it debuted 25 years ago and has stood the test of time, thriving in several other forms, from direct-to-video sequels and TV shows to a wildly successful Broadway musical.

But back to this latest rendition, and notice I wrote that viewers will only take ""temporarily solace"" in it, because even though I think people will mildly enjoy this update, I also think their satisfaction will be short-lived. That's often the case when any remake merely meets our expectations without offering much in the way of surprises. I too sat in the theater thinking, this is when the sun rises and ""Circle of Life"" plays, and this is when Timon says, ""Nothing, what's the motto with you?"" Then those things happened, and then‚Ä¶well, they happened, and that was about it. They happened‚Ä¶just like I thought they would.

What's missing after the statement, ""Then those things happened,"" is the word ""but‚Ä¶"" or ""and‚Ä¶"", followed by some new or interesting development of the story. But the movie is essentially the original ""Lion King,"" only in different visual form, with the catch being it's supposed to be more realistic-looking than its predecessor. And for the record, the movie's look is sharp, exquisite and often wondrous to behold. The African landscapes are highly detailed and render magnificently on the big screen, and the animal characters, even in close-up, are palpable and appear about as real as any actual creature. 

Ironically, though, and part of what makes this newest ""Lion King"" such a disappointment, is that in its effort to look and feel real, it inadvertently creates a sense of detachment from the characters and drama. Traditionally drawn animation, through its deliberate intentions to create a world that's surreal and make-believe, has the inherent advantage of automatically getting us to suspend our feelings of disbelief and easily accept the personification of animals. But in this case, when the recreation of reality is one of the movie's main selling points, watching the animals talk looks awkward and we can't shake the fact it goes against nature. It's not cute and entertaining so much as much as it is strange, even disturbing. Oftentimes, it looks like real animals were filmed and their images later doctored with moving mouths and body parts. It just doesn't look or feel right. A movie like ""Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey,"" which was actually live-action, also featured talking animals, but they communicated with one another not by moving their mouths but through some sort of animal telepathy. This I could accept and it's even fun to believe animals really do this, but watching photorealistic animals talking and singing isn't as fun.

I might have been able to forgive the film for the visual uneasiness its creates‚Äîand for the record, sometimes I was‚Äîhad the story engaged me more, but because I'm one of millions who knows ""The Lion King"" by heart, it would have taken a lot for Jeff Nathanson's screenplay to really surprise me. And what's unfortunate is the filmmakers, led by director Jon Favreau, seem to think we simply want to see and experience what we already know, but they're mistaken. 

During this recent trend of Disney live-action remakes of animated classics, the best have been those that put a different narrative spin on old material (""The Jungle Book"", ""Aladdin""), not just a visual one, and sadly, ""The Lion King"" isn't among them. It's practically a shot-by-shot, dialogue-for-dialogue carbon copy, with just a different veneer. 

The movie once again tells the coming-of-age story of a lion cub named Simba, whose father, Mufasa (voice of James Earl Jones), is king of the Pride Lands and rules ""everything the light touches,"" including all the animals who inhabit it. Simba will one day take the throne and initially thinks a king can simply do whatever he wants, but over the course of the story, he realizes a true king is measured by his compassion toward others and how he lives up to his personal responsibility. In Simba's case, his arduous journey begins after the death of Mufasa, which his evil Uncle Scar (Chiwetel Ejiofor) makes him believe he caused. 

It was always the solemn material and earnest message of ""The Lion King"" that made it so special and set it apart from the typically jolly, kid-oriented Disney fare. And just like the original, this new ""Lion King"" balances its gravity with lighter moments of song, dance, humor, and romance, courtesy of a long line of diverse supporting characters, including Zazu the hornbill (John Oliver), the talky yet loyal advisor to the king; Sarabi (Alfre Woodard), Mufasa's wife and Simba's loving mother; Nala (Beyonc√© Knowles-Carter), the childhood friend and eventual love interest to adult Simba (Donald Glover); Rafiki (John Kani), the sage mandrill who bestows wisdom on Simba and also has a knack for the martial arts; a pack of ruthless, wandering hyenas (Florence Kasumba, Keegan-Michael Key, Eric Andr√©), who scheme with Scar to kill Mufasa and Simba; and of course, Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (Seth Rogen), the meerkat-warthog duo who befriend Simba after he's ostracized and introduce him to the carefree lifestyle philosophy of ""Hakuna Matata."" 

Everything we get from this new ""Lion King"" was to be expected, which is also what's wrong with it. Sure, it has a dazzling new look, but it's not necessarily a better look, and like I said, the moving mouths on the animals sometimes proved distracting. This is all even more of a shame to report because, being a fan favorite and worldwide cultural phenomenon, ""The Lion King"" will inevitably gross millions and provide Disney executives further evidence that fans merely want more of what they've already gotten, with only slight variations. This may be what some viewers think they want (after all, ""comfort movies"" do serve a purpose), but I think what they really desire is to be challenged and presented an alternate take on the old material, or better yet, new material altogether. The movie is safe, easy and heartening to be sure, but is it really exciting? The magic and appeal of any story stems from the simple notion we don't know what's going to happen or how, and unless one is completely foreign to the original ""Lion King"" going into the remake, it has little magic and appeal to speak of.",2019-07-23T21:52:23.049Z,0.0

They didn't add any new factors or spins on it other than the fact that it was a live version. So it was hard not to compare. For example, Alladin  put their own spin on the new version so that I wasn't comparing will smith to robin williams, and therefore the songs and movie really delivered well! The lion king songs were almost snippets, or like low budget versions of the original, didn't compare in the slightest to the original soundtrack; basically a rushed version of the animated version.

It's because this 'masterpiece' easily can get over 1 billion $ without trying. It's sad, that lately Disney  does remakes even without trying to do anything new. But people will see it.

Her changes to the songs were unnecessary and overindulgent, bordering obnoxious. Her voice acting was pretty terrible as well.  Also the changes they made it to the song ""be prepared"" really ruined it for me.  Overall it's cute and  The CGI was pretty cool, although I wish they would've given the animals even the slightest bit more expression‚Ä¶ I know they were trying to be realistic but come on, they are still talking and singing.

The fact that it was so similar to the original is its strength, and knowing where it couldn't even dream of matching the original Timon and Pumbaa, they were smart to let the new actors take it in a slightly different, but still funny direction.

9218,977979335,Michael L,"This is basically just a shot for shot remake of the original, with a couple scenes missing, and while the visuals were incredible, that photo realism can't hold a candle to the stylized animation of the 25 year-old predecessor. Musical numbers fell flat every time (the only exception being the opening ""Circle of Life""). ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"" and ""Be Prepared"" stick out in my mind especially, because all the vibrant beauty of the former and all the explosive symbolism of the latter are completely gone; replaced by regular looking lions walking in a dull environment (by comparison).

SPOILER for a 25 year-old cartoon:

The scene which I feel suffers the worst you could probably guess is Mufasa's murder. The stylized animation of the cartoon allowed for Scar, with a sneering look of evil, to lean in close to his brother and whisper those most infamous words, ""Long live the King,"" right before throwing him to his doom, and the camera holds a tight shot on Mufasa's face as the betrayal sinks in. Meanwhile, Simba can only look on in horror as his father falls to his death, and it's all his fault. All emotion is lost in this seen; a seen that had me in tears consistently for a decade left me feeling nothing but disappointment and longing for a better film. Scar just looks like a regular (albeit somewhat malnourished) lion, and Mufasa looks much the same. As Mufasa is pleading in recalls images of ""Doctor Dolittle"" and ""Babe"" when they would put peanut butter in the animals mouth to simulate talking. Instead of Scar throwing Mufasa into the stampede, he bats at him like a playful kitten. Simba just looks like an agitated cub, and the filmmakers just stuck a scream over the growl. 


SPOILER OVER:

I know this has been entirely negative, but there were some good things about this film. The first and most important is that this movie may turn a whole new generation of kids onto the original cartoon. The second would be that much of the casting was excellent. Of course, James Earl Jones returns, I actually enjoyed Donald Glover as Simba more than Matthew Broderick, and John Oliver was a decent follow up to the great Rowan Atkinson. I was indifferent to Chiwetel Ejiofor's performance compared to Jeremy Irons; I think both are good for similar reasons. However, why in God's good name did they think casting Beyonce as Nala was a good idea. I thought we learned that she couldn't act back in 2002 with ""Goldmember,"" but at least that was comedy so it wasn't as important that she could hold her own in a scene. This movie (I assume) was supposed to be at least semi-serious, and she drags down any scene she's a part of. Oh yeah, Rafiki was pretty great, John Kani did a really good job.

Conclusion:

While there are many scenes which I could go through, and explain how they fall short of the original, I don't have forever. So, in conclusion, ""The Lion King (2019)"" is an inferior film to the first and hopefully it at least turns a couple of kids from a younger generation onto the masterpiece of cinema that is ""The Lion King (1994).""",2019-07-23T19:18:48.933Z,0.0

9223,978168725,Seth H,"I was a big fan of the original Lion King. The animation worked beautiful, allowing beautiful visuals and incredibly expressive faces. It was colorful and fun, the songs were (mostly) really catchy and good, and the biggest moral can still be applied even today.
This new version is a paint-by-number, nearly shot-for-shot remake that unfortunately falls incredibly flat. Going for a photorealistic look with its characters was a poorly-made decision that unfortunately gave nothing to the story, only took away from the characters. As impressive as the CGI looked, this was unfortunately the wrong story to try to showcase it in, as none of the characters emoted anything beyond dull surprise. This was especially detrimental to Mufasa's death (Spoilers? No, anyone seeing this will have seen the original, so that's not a spoiler at all), as in the animated version you could see the horror and desperation in Simba's face as he watched his father fall. In this one, you saw nothing. No emotion. And the biggest moral in the original, Rafiki teaching Simba that you can either run from your past, or learn from it, was completely cut out of the film. In addition, Scar's song was only barely given lip service, probably because they knew they would not be able to do it well with the technology they were showcasing.
Another unnecessary ""live action"" remake by Disney in the same vein as all the others, purely a cash grab taking advantage of nostalgia, and make easy money, when all the funding for this could have gone towards making some new original animated story.",2019-07-23T19:12:50.127Z,0.0

That's how I felt here. I LOVE the original, and seeing it come to dazzling real life is stunning. Until, that is, you realize it's practically a shot-for-shot remake of the original. No surprises. No twists. No vocal pizzazz, save for James Earl Jones, regal as ever. What did end up on the cutting-room floor was the best joke from the comic relief, which is now passe in our PC world. In it's place is some tongue-in-cheek self-promotion from Disney, and forced diatribe about fat-shaming that they used to their own advantage not five minutes earlier. My daughter loved it, and she understood all the good points of the story well enough: it's okay to make mistakes, face those mistakes and don't run from them, it is better to serve others than to take from them, a good parent can be authoritative AND offer grace...Are those good things to reinforce in our families? Absolutely. Could I have saved 28, plus gas, plus concessions, and gotten the same lessons at home with the original? Yup. See it through your kids' eyes and be amazed.

9354,974807001,ANDERSON G,"""The Lion King"" was one of the biggest expectations of the year, re-reading one of disney's greatest classics with a new, modern, more real, dramatic and dazzling outfit, delivered in parts, of course, the Live Action version of classic animation is a step further in technological terms, as Toy Store did in 95, or even the movie ""Dinosaur"" made in two thousand years, here we have an innovation before our eyes, the movement capture sharpened to a level amazing together with beautiful visual effects. ""The Lion King"" may have some problems, but visually it was amazing.

We all wanted a movie similar to the animation, and so they did, but deep down, we felt a frustration, that of not seeing something new, of knowing the steps following the script, of not feeling the same emotion of the drawing. Coupled with a troubled voice acting - both the Brazilian and the original - and even, a detachment from the characters caused by the passing of more than two decades, are ingredients that end up creating a cold film, we do not feel its update or renewal, It's like looking at something spinning around itself.

Despite the great looks, beautiful scenery, excellent animations, the new re-read of ""The Lion King"" does not match its original, but is nonetheless a good movie, which will serve as a technological standard for cinema and even a readjustment lesson for Disney. .",2019-07-23T16:22:07.013Z,1.0
9355,946080299,Jeff R,"The animation technology was the main feature of this remake. Across the board, the talent used to voice the characters in this version were so much worse than the original voice actors.

Real Animals don's show facial expressions so all the high and low moments you know are part of the story are simply not there.  We came home and watched our 25-year-old VCR tapes of LK 1, 2 & 1/2 just to get the taste out of our mouths. I'd really like my money back. It was awful!  Lion King 2 was the only direct to video sequel to play on Disney or FreeForm right after LK1.  These characters are THAT well known!  Favereau & Disney execs were out of their depth on this one!  Replacing almost all the original LIVING cast members was an abysmal idea!  I disagree with many about Beyonce- she sounds like Moria Kelly and was good. But to add a new song just for Beyonce and ""can you feel the love tonight?"" in the middle of the afternoon- were you paying attention?  The only redeeming factor was that we had a great laugh at how awful this word for word but not-remake was.  I'd really like my money back so I could go see something new and original.

9416,978156659,Price P,"While the visuals are without a doubt spectacular, and some of the performances are phenomenal (Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner, Donald Glover, and Beyonc√© in particular) the film itself feels very off. It pains me to say this because I'm a huge fan of Favreau's directing but the delivery of some lines feel either rushed or dull, the animation (while very well done) takes a away some of if not all of the facial expressions which makes it feel very underwhelming, and while the film doesn't try to be the ""New"" Lion King, it doesn't do much to differentiate itself from the classic, which will have you thinking of it while watching this film, I hate to say it again but after seeing ""The Jungle Book (2016)"" I was expecting a little more from this film, but if you'd like to see a lion documentary with some classic songs now sung by famous celebrities, it's worth a watch.",2019-07-23T15:17:59.064Z,0.0

She too much of a diva to be part of Disney in my opinion. Disney overall is becoming less and less original in their movies. They‚Äôre taking the movies and remaking them... Disney used to be known as an innovator when it came to children‚Äôs entertainment, whether it was animation or live-action. But now, it‚Äôs almost as if they‚Äôve run out of ideas. Remaking their animation classics is getting old, fast. Next movie they make I will be waiting for it to be released on DVD/Blu-Ray... very disappointing. üò¢",2019-07-23T14:57:15.398Z,0.0

2. I thought that they did a wonderful job expressing the animals emotions in a manner that is more in line with how animals act and express themselves. This makes the emotions harder to discern since they could not rely on the freedom that was provided through animation to over emote, but I think that it did add a subtle value and realness to those emotions. Think ear movement, tails wagging, body language.

3. The two worse voice actors in the movie were Beyonce and Donald Glover. No shots at them, I just think it became clear that these two people tried to fit this movie into their schedule as opposed to clearing their schedule for this movie like maybe some of the other voice actors were able to do. I don't think the actors were ever together while they were voicing the scenes and it shows.",2019-07-23T14:44:43.001Z,1.0

I found myself contemplating for 2 days afterwards why. My conclusion is the cast of voice over actors failed to evoke any real emotion or energy to allow an attachment to the characters and movie as they should. Now dont get me wrong I love Beyonc, but maybe she should stick to singing from here on out. She exudes so much emotion and inflections in the tone of her voice when singing. However as the character Nala i feel like she was very monotone and and completely lacking any emotion,energy, and tonal inflections that allow you to connect with a character and a movie. It sort of ruined it for me. I connected with the cartoon version more than I did with the live action current version and that shouldnt be the case. It was beautiful visually but a total miss with character voice over choices.",2019-07-23T14:42:14.964Z,0.0
9464,978168484,Cam W,"While 'The Lion King' is a very fun time that will take most fans of the original on a giant nostalgia trip, there are still some glaring issues in the voice acting and trying to capture the same magic of the original. The CGI in this movie is absolutly perfect, every single animal looks incredible. The movie struggles to achieve the same amount of magic as the original Lion King in 1994. While the music is also incredible it is impossible for the live action version to have the same joy, heart, and magic of the original. Billy Eichren and Seth Rogan were clearly given the most freedom with their lines as it seemed like everyone else was restricted to the script. James Earl Jones does a wonderful job as Mufasa but with age his voice seems to be less powerfull than it once was. Donald Glover was not given much time to come into the role as Simba and struggled to capture emotion with his voice in some scenes. While the Hyenas were henchman (almost bit characters) to Scar in the original they were given a larger role and had much more screen time which I didn't feel resonated well.

The initial reviews from critic screenings said this was the best live action movies to date and then a week or so later the reviews changed.  I would suggest not reading the reviews and just go see this movie.  The director builds off the magic he created in The Jungle Book and truly brings these characters alive.

9520,dab1b87e-b588-4200-9aef-4a53b472750e,Garrett W,"I'd recommend anyone see 2019's The Lion King for the sheer visual spectacle alone. The scenery is stunning and the CGI is near-flawless. You'll be overwhelmed by the beauty of the African plains of the Pride Lands and of the subtropical jungle where Timon and Pumba reside.

The performances are strong and best and okay at worst. Standouts include James Earl Jones and Donald Glover (especially his singing).

The film does feel like an unnecessary, unneeded update to a superior film. It's fun for the spectacle, but does nothing to change or significantly update the mythos surrounding the Lion King. I think the biggest indictment on the film is that as I was walking out of the theater, my first thought was, ""I really want to go watch the original now.""",2019-07-23T13:58:35.976Z,0.0

It was pretty much shot for shot which is probably the safest route they could have gone to avoid angering long time fans of the this much beloved classic. I however was hoping for a little more personally. I was also not a fan of the new ""Be Prepared"" or ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight.""
